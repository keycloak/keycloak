summary="Understand basic concepts for securing applications.">

As an OAuth2, OpenID Connect and SAML compliant server, {project_name} can secure any application and service as long
as the technology stack they are using supports any of these protocols. For more details about the security protocols
supported by {project_name}, consider looking at link:{adminguide_link}#sso-protocols[{adminguide_name}].

Most of the support for some of these protocols is already available from the programming language, framework,
or reverse proxy they are using. Leveraging the support already available from the application ecosystem is a key aspect to make your
application fully compliant with security standards and best practices, so that you avoid vendor lock-in.

For some programming languages, {project_name} provides libraries that try to fill the gap for the lack of support of
a particular security protocol or to provide a more rich and tightly coupled integration with the server. These libraries
are known by *Keycloak Client Adapters*, and they should be used as a last resort if you cannot rely on what is available
from the application ecosystem.
