== Troubleshooting

The best way to troubleshoot problems is to turn on debugging for SAML in both the client adapter and {project_name} Server. Using your logging framework, set the log level to `DEBUG` for the `org.keycloak.saml` package. Turning this on allows you to see the SAML requests and response documents being sent to and from the server.
