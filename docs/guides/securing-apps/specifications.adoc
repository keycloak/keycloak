title="Specifications implemented"
priority=130
summary="List of specifications and standards implemented by {project_name}.">

This {section} presents a list of specifications and standards that {project_name} currently implements. The standards are separated in different sections and, in each one, a table is shown with the following four columns:

* *Specification*: The standard or specification that {project_name} implements.
* *Status*: The current status of the implementation inside {project_name} (supported, preview, experimental,...). See <@links.server id="features"/> for more information.
* *Conformity*: Assurance of conformity of the implementation.
** *Certified (version)*: The specification provides conformance tests that {project_name} executes periodically and for each new version. The version in brackets is the last version of {project_name} certified by the authority.
** *Passed*: There are conformance tests provided by the authority that {project_name} passes, but no version is certified yet.
** *Partial*: There are conformance tests but {project_name} is not yet fully passing them.
** If this column is empty means that {project_name} does not pass any external conformance tests for the spec. Only common project integration tests are executed. Maybe the authority does not provide a conformance tests suite or {project_name} is not interested in passing them.
* *Comments*: A generic column that can contain details of the implementation or the status. For example parts that are not covered yet or specific behaviors out of the spec.
