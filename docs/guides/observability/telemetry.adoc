title="Centralize your observability stack with OpenTelemetry"
summary="Learn about OpenTelemetry integration for centralized observability and telemetry data.">

https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/[OpenTelemetry] (OTel) is an open-source observability framework designed to provide consistent and reliable ways to collect telemetry data across distributed systems.
It is a project under the https://www.cncf.io/projects/opentelemetry/[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)] as an incubating project.
Its goal is to provide a unified standard and toolset for instrumenting, generating, and exporting telemetry data from modern applications, making it easier to monitor, debug, and understand complex services.

The goal of {project_name} is to support OpenTelemetry Logs, Metrics, and Traces to create a centralized observability stack without any additional deployment overhead.

== General options
{project_name} provides support for global settings of telemetry data export.
It means that you can configure connection parameters to a single https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/[OpenTelemetry collector] that will be used for all supported components.

In order to have OpenTelemetry enabled, at least one component needs to be turned on, for example <<traces, Traces>>.

NOTE: The OpenTelemetry feature is _enabled_ by default. Disable the feature in order to disable OpenTelemetry components.

=== Endpoint
You can configure the OpenTelemetry collector's global endpoint that is shared across all components by using the `telemetry-endpoint` option.
The default value is `+http://localhost:4317+`.

You can change the endpoint via CLI as follows:

<@kc.start parameters="--telemetry-endpoint=http://my-otel-endpoint:4317"/>

=== Service name
You can configure the global OpenTelemetry service name used for identifying the exporter of the telemetry data.
The default service name is `keycloak`, specified via the `telemetry-service-name` property, which takes precedence over `service.name` defined in the `telemetry-resource-attributes` property.

You can change the service name via CLI as follows:

<@kc.start parameters="--telemetry-service-name=my-keycloak-iam"/>

=== Protocol
You can configure the global OpenTelemetry transport protocol used as a communication channel between {project_name} and the OpenTelemetry collector.
The default value is `grpc`.

{project_name} supports these communication protocols:

<@opts.expectedValues option="telemetry-protocol"/>

You can change the protocol via CLI as follows:

<@kc.start parameters="--telemetry-protocol=http/protobuf"/>

== Traces

{project_name} has already supported OpenTelemetry Tracing for some time, and you can find more information in the https://www.keycloak.org/observability/tracing[Root cause analysis with tracing guide].

You can override the global OpenTelemetry settings via the Tracing options if you want to export traces to a different OpenTelemetry collector.

<@opts.printRelevantOptions includedOptions="telemetry-*">

=== Traces
<@opts.includeOptions includedOptions="tracing-enabled tracing-endpoint tracing-protocol tracing-service-name tracing-resource-attributes"/>

</@opts.printRelevantOptions>
