== Metrics

:jgrp_application: {project_name}
:clustered_caches: true

Deploying multiple {project_name} nodes allows the load to be distributed amongst them, but this requires communication between the nodes.
This section describes metrics that are useful for monitoring the communication between {project_name} in order to identify possible faults.

NOTE: This is relevant only for single-cluster deployments.
When multiple clusters are used, as described in <@links.ha id="multi-cluster-introduction"/>, {project_name} nodes are not clustered together and therefore there is no communication between them directly.
