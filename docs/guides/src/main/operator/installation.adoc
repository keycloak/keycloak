== Keycloak Operator Installation
In this guide we will show how to install the Keycloak Operator in your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.

=== OLM Installation

The recommended way to install the Keycloak Operator in Kubernetes environments is to use the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

==== Prerequisites
Make sure OLM is installed in your environment. For Guidance on how to install OLM, follow this https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/install/install.md#install-a-release[guide].

The Keycloak Operator OLM package can be installed from the OLM catalog. For general instructions on how to install operators using OLM, follow the https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/tasks/install-operator-with-olm/[instructions] on the OLM page.
In the default Catalog, the Keycloak Operator is named `keycloak-operator`. Make sure to use the `candidate` channel to find the operator.

==== OpenShift UI

On OpenShift, use the built-in OLM UI to install the Keycloak Operator.
Navigate to `Home`, `Operators`, `OperatorHub` using the menu on the left side of the OpenShift Console.
Search for "keycloak" on the search input box:

image::{generatedGuideImages}/select-operator.jpeg["Select the Keycloak Operator in the UI"]

Select the Keycloak Operator from the list of results. After that, follow the instructions on the screen. Make sure you are installing from the `candidate` channel:

=== Vanilla Kubernetes Installation

To install the operator on a vanilla Kubernetes cluster, you first need to install its CRDs by running the following commands:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keycloak/keycloak-k8s-resources/{version}/kubernetes/keycloaks.k8s.keycloak.org-v1.yml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keycloak/keycloak-k8s-resources/{version}/kubernetes/keycloakrealmimports.k8s.keycloak.org-v1.yml
----

After successfull CRD installation, install the Keycloak Operator deployment by running the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keycloak/keycloak-k8s-resources/{version}/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml
----

Currently the operator watches only the namespace where the operator is installed.
