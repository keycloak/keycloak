Keycloak supports a file based vault implementation for Kubernetes / OpenShift secrets. Mount Kubernetes secrets as data volumes, and they appear in a directory with a flat-file structure. Keycloak represents each secret as a file with the file’s name as the secret name and the file’s content as the secret value.

== Available integrations
You can use Kubernetes / OpenShift secrets for the following use-cases:

* Obtain the SMTP Mail server Password
* Obtain the LDAP Bind Credential when using LDAP-based User Federation
* Obtain the OIDC identity providers Client Secret when integrating external identity providers

== Enabling the vault
Enable the file based vault by building Keycloak using the following build option:

<@kc.build parameters="--vault=file"/>

== Setting the base directory to lookup secrets
Kubernetes / OpenShift secrets are basically mounted files, so you have to configure a directory for these files to be mounted in:

<@kc.start parameters="--vault-dir=/my/path"/>

== Realm-specific secret files
Kubernetes / OpenShift Secrets are used per-realm basis in Keycloak, so there's a naming convention for the file in place:
[source, bash]
----
${r"${vault.<realmname>_<secretname>}"}
----

=== Using underscores in the Name
In order to process the secret correctly, it is needed to double all underscores in the <realmname> or the <secretname>, separated by a single underscore.

.Example
* Realm Name: `sso_realm`
* Desired Name: `ldap_credential`
* Resulting file Name:
[source, bash]
----
sso__realm_ldap__credential
----
Note the doubled underscores between __sso__ and __realm__ and also between __ldap__ and __credential__.

== Example: Use an LDAP bind credential secret in the admin console

.Example setup
* A realm named `secrettest`
* A desired Name `ldapBc` for the bind Credential
* Resulting file name: `secrettest_ldapBc`

.Usage in admin console
You can then use this secret from the admin console by using  `${r"${vault.ldapBc}"}` as value for the `Bind Credential` when configuring your LDAP User federation.
