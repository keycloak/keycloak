## Secure your first app

Let's try to secure our first application. First step is to register this application with your Keycloak instance:

. Open the {links-admin-console}
. Click 'Clients'
. Click 'Create client'
. Fill in the form with the following values:
** Client type: `OpenID Connect`
** Client ID: `myclient`
. Click 'Next'
. Make sure 'Standard flow' is enabled
. Click 'Save'

After the client is created you need to update the following values for the client:

. Valid redirect URIs: `https://www.keycloak.org/app/*`
. Web origins: `https://www.keycloak.org`

Remember to click `Save`.

To make it easy for you we have a SPA testing application available on the https://www.keycloak.org/app/[Keycloak website].

ifeval::[{links-local}==true]
Open https://www.keycloak.org/app/ and click `Save` to use the default configuration.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{links-local}!=true]
Open https://www.keycloak.org/app/. Change `Keycloak URL` to the URL of your Keycloak instance. Click `Save`.
endif::[]

Now you can click `Sign in` to authenticate to this application using the Keycloak server you started earlier.
