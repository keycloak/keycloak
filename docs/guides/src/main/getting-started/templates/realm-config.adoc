== Login to the admin console

Go to the {links-admin-console} and login with the username and password
you created earlier.

== Create a realm

A realm in Keycloak is the equivalent of a tenant. It allows creating isolated groups of applications and users. By default
there is a single realm in Keycloak called `master`. This is dedicated to manage Keycloak and should not be used for
your own applications.

Let's create our first realm.

. Open the {links-admin-console}
. Hover the mouse over the dropdown in the top-left corner where it says `master`, then click on `Create realm`
. Fill in the form with the following values:
** Realm name: `myrealm`
. Click `Create`

== Create a user

Initially there are no users in a new realm, so let's create one:

. Open the {links-admin-console}
. Click `Users` (left-hand menu)
* Click `Create new user` (top-right corner of table)
. Fill in the form with the following values:
** Username: `myuser`
** First Name: Your first name
** Last Name: Your last name
. Click `Create`

The user will need an initial password set to be able to login. To do this:

. Click `Credentials` (top of the page)
. Fill in the `Set password` form with a password
. Click `ON` next to `Temporary` to prevent having to update password on first login
