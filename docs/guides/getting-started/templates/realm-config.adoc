== Log in to the Admin Console

. Go to the {links-admin-console}.
. Log in with the username and password you created earlier.

== Create a realm

A realm in {project_name} is equivalent to a tenant. Each realm allows an administrator to create isolated groups of applications and users. Initially, {project_name}
includes a single realm, called `master`. Use this realm only for managing {project_name} and not for managing any applications.

Use these steps to create the first realm.

. Open the {links-admin-console}.
. Click *Create Realm* next to *Current realm*.
. Enter `myrealm` in the *Realm name* field.
. Click *Create*.

.Add realm

== Create a user

Initially, the realm has no users. Use these steps to create a user:

. Verify that you are still in the *myrealm* realm, which is next to *Current realm*.
. Click *Users* in the left-hand menu.
. Click *Create new user*.
. Fill in the form with the following values:
** *Username*: `myuser`
** *First name*: any first name
** *Last name*: any last name
. Click *Create*.

.Create user

This user needs a password to log in. To set the initial password:

. Click *Credentials* at the top of the page.
. Fill in the *Set password* form with a password.
. Toggle *Temporary* to *Off* so that the user does not need to update this password at the first login.
