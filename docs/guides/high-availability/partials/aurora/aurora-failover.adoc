Assuming a Regional multi-AZ Aurora deployment, the current writer instance should be in the same region as the active Keycloak cluster to avoid latencies and communication across availability zones.

Switching the writer instance of Aurora will lead to a small downtime, and having the writer instance in the other site with a slightly longer latency might be acceptable for some deployments.
So this might be deferred to a maintenance window or skipped depending on the circumstances of the deployment.

To change the writer instance, run a failover.
This will make the database unavailable for a short time.
{project_name} will need to re-establish database connections.

To fail over the writer instance to the other AZ, issue the following command:

[source,bash]
----
aws rds failover-db-cluster  --db-cluster-identifier ...
----
