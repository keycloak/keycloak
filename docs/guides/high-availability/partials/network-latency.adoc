See https://www.cloudping.co/ for an overview of AWS latencies inside of a region, for example, from eu-west-1 to eu-west-1.
The latency within a region is the latency between AZs.
////

A round-trip latency of less than 5 ms is suggested and below 10 ms is required, together with a reliable network between the zones to avoid unexpected problems with latency, throughput or connectivity.

Network latency and latency spikes amplify in the response time of the service and can lead to queued requests, timeouts, and failed requests.
Networking problems can cause downtimes until the failure detection isolates problematic nodes.
