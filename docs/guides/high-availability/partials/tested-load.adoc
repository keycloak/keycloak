We regularly test {project_name} with the following load:
</@profile.ifCommunity>

* 100,000 users
<@profile.ifProduct>
* 300 requests per second
</@profile.ifProduct>
<@profile.ifCommunity>
* 1000 logins per second with 20000 token refreshes per second.
* 6 Pods single-cluster setup across 3 availability zones in one region
** Each Pod with limits of 40 vCPU and 8 GB memory
* Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL multi-az database deployed in two availability zones
** Instance type: `db.r8g.16xlarge` for both reader and writer instance
</@profile.ifCommunity>

<@profile.ifCommunity>
While we did not see a hard limit in our tests with these values, we ask you to test for higher volumes with horizontally and vertically scaled {project_name} name instances and databases.
