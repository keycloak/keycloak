We regularly test {project_name} with the following load:
</@profile.ifCommunity>

* 100,000 users
<@profile.ifProduct>
* 300 requests per second
</@profile.ifProduct>
<@profile.ifCommunity>
* 1000 logins per second with 20000 refreshes per second.
* 6 Pods
** Each Pod with limits: 40vCPU and 8GB Memory
* Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database
** Instance type: `db.r8g.16xlarge`
</@profile.ifCommunity>

<@profile.ifCommunity>
While we did not see a hard limit in our tests with these values, we ask you to test for higher volumes with horizontally and vertically scaled {project_name} name instances and databases.
