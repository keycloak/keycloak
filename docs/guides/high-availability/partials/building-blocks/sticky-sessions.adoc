[#${parent}-sticky-sessions]
== Optional: Disable sticky sessions

When running on OpenShift and the default passthrough Ingress setup as provided by the {project_name} Operator, the load balancing done by HAProxy is done by using sticky sessions based on the IP address of the source.
When running load tests, or when having a reverse proxy in front of HAProxy, you might want to disable this setup to avoid receiving all requests on a single {project_name} Pod.

Add the following supplementary configuration under the `spec` in the {project_name} Custom Resource to disable sticky sessions.

    enabled: true

      # When running load tests, disable sticky sessions on the OpenShift HAProxy router
      # to avoid receiving all requests on a single {project_name} Pod.
