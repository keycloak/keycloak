summary="Explore the different {project_name} high-availability architectures" >

{project_name} supports different high-availability architectures, allowing system administrators to pick the deployment type most suitable
for their needs. Ease of deployment, cost and fault-tolerance guarantees are important considerations when determining the correct architecture
for your deployments.

== Architectures

This document describes two architectures to deploy {project_name}: Single-cluster deployments and multi-cluster deployments.

=== Single-cluster deployments

Deploy {project_name} in a single cluster, optionally across multiple availability-zones in the same region, using <@links.ha id="single-cluster-introduction" />.

Advantages::
* No external dependencies

<@profile.ifProduct>

* Deployment in a single {kubernetes} cluster

</@profile.ifProduct>

<@profile.ifCommunity>

* Deployment in a single {kubernetes} cluster or a set of virtual machines with transparent networking

</@profile.ifCommunity>

* Tolerate availability-zone failures if deployed to multiple availability zones

Disadvantages::
* {kubernetes} cluster is a single point of failure:
** Control-plane failures could impact all {project_name} pods

=== Multi-cluster deployments

Connect two {project_name} clusters deployed for example in different {kubernetes} clusters in two availability zones to increase availability using <@links.ha id="multi-cluster-introduction" />.

Advantages::
* Tolerate availability-zone failure
* Tolerate {kubernetes} cluster failure
* Bridge two networks that do not offer transparent networking
* Regulatory compliance when distinct deployments are required

Disadvantages::
* Complexity:
** External load-balancer required
** Separate {jdgserver_name} cluster required on each site
* Cost:
** Additional load-balancer required
** Additional compute is required for external {jdgserver_name} clusters
** Two {kubernetes} control-planes must be provisioned
* Not supported with three or more availability zones

=== Next Steps

To learn more about the different high-availability architectures and their supported configurations, please consult the individual {sections}.
