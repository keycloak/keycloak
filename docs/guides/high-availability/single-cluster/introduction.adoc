== When to use a single-cluster setup

The {project_name} single-cluster setup is targeted at use cases that:

* Deploy to an infrastructure with transparent networking, like for example a single {kubernetes} cluster.
* Desire all healthy {project_name} instances to handle user requests.
* Are constrained to a single
<@profile.ifProduct>
AWS Region.
</@profile.ifProduct>
<@profile.ifCommunity>
AWS Region or an equivalent low-latency setup.
</@profile.ifCommunity>
* Permit planned outages for maintenance.
* Fit within a defined user and request count.
* Can accept the impact of periodic outages.

[#single-cluster-tested-configuration]
== Tested Configuration

We regularly test {project_name} with the following configuration:

* An OpenShift cluster deployed across three availability zones
** Provisioned with https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/aws[Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS] (ROSA),
using ROSA HCP.

** At least one worker node for each availability-zone
** OpenShift version 4.17.

* Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database
** High availability with a primary DB instance in one availability zone, and synchronously replicated readers in the other availability zones
** Version ${properties["aurora-postgresql.version"]}

[#single-cluster-supported-configuration]
== Supported Configurations

The following configurations are supported:

<@profile.ifProduct>

* {project_name} deployed on an OpenShift cluster version 4.17 or later
** For cloud setups, Pods can be scheduled across up to three availability zones within the same region
if OpenShift supports spanning multiple availability zones in that environment and {project_name}'s latency requirements are met.
** For on-premise setups, Pods can be scheduled across up to three datacenters
if OpenShift supports spanning multiple datacenters in that environment and {project_name}'s latency requirements are met.

</@profile.ifProduct>

<@profile.ifCommunity>

* {project_name} deployed on a {kubernetes} cluster
** For cloud setups, Pods can be scheduled across multiple availability zones within the same region
if {project_name}'s latency requirements are met.
** For on-premise setups, Pods can be scheduled across multiple datacenters
if {project_name}'s latency requirements are met.
* {project_name} deployed on a virtual machines or bare metal
** Instances can be scheduled across multiple availability zones within the same cloud-provider region or multiple datacenters if {project_name}'s latency requirements are met.

</@profile.ifCommunity>

* Deployments require a P50 round-trip latency of less than 10 ms between {project_name} instances.

* Database
** For a list of supported databases, see <@links.server id="db"/>.
** Deployments spanning multiple availability zones must utilize a database that can tolerate zone failures
and synchronously replicates data between replicas.

[#single-cluster-limitations]
== Limitations

<@profile.ifCommunity>
Even with the additional redundancy of three availability-zones, downtime can still occur when:
</@profile.ifCommunity>

* Simultaneous node failures occur
* Rolling out {project_name} upgrades
* Infrastructure fails, for example the {kubernetes} cluster

For more details on limitations see the <@links.ha id="single-cluster-concepts" /> {section}.

== Next steps

The different {sections} introduce the necessary concepts and building blocks.
For each building block, a blueprint shows how to deploy a fully functional example.
Additional performance tuning and security hardening are still recommended when preparing a production setup.
