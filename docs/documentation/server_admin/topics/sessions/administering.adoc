=== Administering sessions

To see a top-level view of the active clients and sessions in {project_name}, click *Sessions* from the menu.

==== Signing out all active sessions

You can sign out all users in the realm. From the *Action* list, select *Sign out all active sessions*. All SSO cookies become invalid. {project_name} notifies clients by using the {project_name} OIDC client adapter of the logout event. Clients requesting authentication within active browser sessions must log in again. Client types such as SAML do not receive a back-channel logout request.

[NOTE]
====
Clicking *Sign out all active sessions* does not revoke outstanding access tokens. Outstanding tokens must expire naturally. For clients using the {project_name} OIDC client adapter, you can push a <<_revocation-policy, revocation policy>> to revoke the token, but this does not work for other adapters.
