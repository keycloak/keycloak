== Creating the first administrator

After installing {project_name}, you need an administrator account that can act as a _super_ admin with full permissions to manage {project_name}. With this account, you can log in to the {project_name} Admin Console where you create realms and users and register applications that are secured by {project_name}.

=== Creating the account on the local host

If your server is accessible from `localhost`, perform these steps.

.Procedure

. In a web browser, go to the http://localhost:8080{kc_base_path} URL.

. Supply a username and password that you can recall.

=== Creating the account remotely

If you cannot access the server from a `localhost` address or just want to start {project_name} from the command line, use the `KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables to create an initial admin account.

For example:
[source,bash]
----
export KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=<username>
export KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>

bin/kc.[sh|bat] start
----
