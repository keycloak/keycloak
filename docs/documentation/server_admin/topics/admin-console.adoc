== Configuring realms

Once you have an administrative account for the Admin Console, you can configure realms. A realm is a space where you manage objects, including users, applications, roles, and groups.  A user belongs to and logs into a realm.   One {project_name} deployment can define, store, and manage as many realms as there is space for in the database.
