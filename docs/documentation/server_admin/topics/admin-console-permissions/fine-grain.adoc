=== Fine grained admin permissions V1

IMPORTANT: fine-grained admin permissions V1 have been replaced by a <<_fine_grained_permissions, new version>>.
Version 1 of the feature is still marked as preview and is available, but it may be deprecated and removed
in future. To enable it, start the server with `--features=admin-fine-grained-authz:v1`.

Sometimes roles like `manage-realm` or `manage-users` are too coarse grain and you want to create
restricted admin accounts that have more fine grain permissions.  {project_name} allows you to define
and assign restricted access policies for managing a realm.  Things like:

* Managing one specific client
* Managing users that belong to a specific group
* Managing membership of a group
* Limited user management.
* Fine grain impersonation control
* Being able to assign a specific restricted set of roles to users.
* Being able to assign a specific restricted set of roles to a composite role.
* Being able to assign a specific restricted set of roles to a client's scope.
* New general policies for viewing and managing users, groups, roles, and clients.

There are some important things to note about fine grain admin permissions:

* Fine grain admin permissions were implemented on top of link:{authorizationguide_link}[Authorization Services].  It is highly recommended that you read up on those features before diving into fine grain permissions.
* Fine grain permissions are only available within <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, dedicated admin consoles>> and admins defined within those realms.  You cannot define cross-realm fine grain permissions.
* Fine grain permissions are used to grant additional permissions.  You cannot override the
  default behavior of the built-in admin roles.

==== Managing one specific client

Let's look first at allowing
an admin to manage one client and one client only.  In our example, we have a realm
called `test` and a client called `sales-application`.  In the realm `test` we will give a
user in that realm permission to only manage that application.

IMPORTANT: You cannot do cross realm fine grain permissions.  Admins in the `master` realm are limited to the predefined admin roles defined in previous chapters.

===== Permission setup

The first thing we must do is login to the Admin Console so we can set up permissions for that client.  We navigate to the management section
of the client, we want to define fine-grain permissions for.

.Client management
image:images/fine-grain-client.png[Fine grain client]

You should see a tab menu item called `Permissions`.  Click on that tab.

.Client permissions tab
image:images/fine-grain-client-permissions-tab-off.png[Fine grain client permissions tab]

By default, each client is not enabled to do fine grain permissions.  So turn the `Permissions Enabled` switch to on
to initialize permissions.

IMPORTANT: If you turn the `Permissions Enabled` switch to off, it will delete any and all permissions you have defined for this client.

.Client permissions tab
image:images/fine-grain-client-permissions-tab-on.png[Fine grain permission tab]

When you switch `Permissions Enabled` to on, it initializes various permission objects behind the scenes
using link:{authorizationguide_link}[Authorization Services].  For this example, we're
interested in the `manage` permission for the client.  Clicking on that will redirect you
to the permission that handles the `manage` permission for the client.  All authorization
objects are contained in the `realm-management` client's `Authorization` tab.

.Client manage permission
image:images/fine-grain-client-manage-permissions.png[Fine grain client manage permission ]

When first initialized the `manage` permission does not have any policies associated with it.
You will need to create one by going to the policy tab.  To get there fast, click on
the `Client details` link shown in the above image. Then click on the policies tab.

On this page, look for the `Create client policy` button, which you can use to define many policies.  You can define a policy that is associated with a role or a group or even define
rules in JavaScript.  For this simple example, we are going to create a `User Policy`.

.User policy
image:images/fine-grain-client-user-policy.png[Fine grain client user policy]

This policy will match a hard-coded user in the user database.  In this case, it is the `sales-admin` user.  We must then go back to the
`sales-application` client's `manage` permission page and assign the policy to the permission object.

.Assign user policy
image:images/fine-grain-client-assign-user-policy.png[Fine grain client assign user policy]

The `sales-admin` user now has permission to manage the `sales-application` client.

There is one more thing we have to do.  Go to `Users`, select the `sales-admin` user, then go to the `Role Mappings` tab and assign the `query-clients` role to the user.

.Assign query-clients
image:images/fine-grain-assign-query-clients.png[Fine grain assign query clients]

Why do you have to do this?  This role tells the Admin Console
what menu items to render when the `sales-admin` visits the Admin Console.  The `query-clients`
role tells the Admin Console that it should render client menus for the `sales-admin` user.

IMPORTANT If you do not set the `query-clients` role, restricted admins like `sales-admin` will not see any menu options when they log into the Admin Console

===== Testing it out

Next, we log out of the master realm and re-login to the <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, dedicated admin console>> for the `test` realm
using the `sales-admin` as a username.  This is located under `{kc_admins_path}/test/console`.

.Sales admin login
image:images/fine-grain-sales-admin-login.png[Fine grain sales admin login]

This admin is now able to manage this one client.

==== Restrict user role mapping

Another thing you might want to do is to restrict the set of roles an admin is allowed
to assign to a user.  Continuing our last example, let's expand the permission set of the 'sales-admin'
user so that he can also control which users are allowed to access this application.  Through fine grain permissions, we can
enable it so that the `sales-admin` can only assign roles that grant specific access to
the `sales-application`.  We can also restrict it so that the admin can only map roles
and not perform any other types of user administration.

The `sales-application` has defined three different client roles.

.Sales application roles
image:images/fine-grain-sales-application-roles.png[Fine grain sales application roles]

We want the `sales-admin` user to be able to map these roles to any user in the system.  The
first step to do this is to allow the role to be mapped by the admin.  If we click on the
`viewLeads` role, you'll see that there is a `Permissions` tab for this role.

.View leads role permission tab
image:images/fine-grain-view-leads-role-tab.png[Fine grain view leads role]

If we click on that tab and turn the `Permissions Enabled` on, you'll see that there
are a number of actions we can apply policies to.

.View leads permissions
image:images/fine-grain-view-leads-permissions.png[Fine grain view leads permissions]

The one we are interested in is `map-role`.  Click on this permission and add the same
User Policy that was created in the earlier example.

.Map-roles permission
image:images/fine-grain-map-roles-permission.png[Fine grain map roles permission]

What we've done is say that the `sales-admin` can map the `viewLeads` role.  What we have
not done is specify which users the admin is allowed to map this role too.  To do that
we must go to the `Users` section of the admin console for this realm.  Clicking on the
`Users` left menu item brings us to the users interface of the realm.  You should see a
`Permissions` tab.  Click on that and enable it.

.Users permissions
image:images/fine-grain-users-permissions.png[Fine grain user permissions]

The permission we are interested in is `map-roles`.  This is a restrictive policy
in that it only allows admins the ability to map roles to a user.  If we click on the
`map-roles` permission and again add the User Policy we created for this, our `sales-admin`
will be able to map roles to any user.

The last thing we have to do is add the `view-users` role to the `sales-admin`.  This will
allow the admin to view users in the realm he wants to add the `sales-application` roles to.

.Add view-users
image:images/fine-grain-add-view-users.png[Fine grain add view users]


===== Testing it out

Next, we log out of the master realm and re-login to the <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, dedicated admin console>> for the `test` realm
using the `sales-admin` as a username.  This is located under `{kc_admins_path}/test/console`.

You will see that now the `sales-admin` can view users in the system.  If you select one of the
users you'll see that each user detail page is read only, except for the `Role Mappings` tab.
Going to this tab you'll find that there are no `Available` roles for the admin to
map to the user except when we browse the `sales-application` roles.

.Assign viewLeads
image:images/fine-grain-add-view-leads.png[Fine grain add view leads]

We've only specified that the `sales-admin` can map the `viewLeads` role.

===== Per client map-roles shortcut

It would be tedious if we had to do this for every client role that the `sales-application` published.
to make things easier, there's a way to specify that an admin can map any role defined
by a client.  If we log back into the admin console to our master realm admin and go back
  to the `sales-application` permissions page, you'll see the `map-roles` permission.

.Client map-roles permission
image:images/fine-grain-client-permissions-tab-on.png[Fine grain client permissions]

If you grant access to this particular permission to an admin, that admin will be able
map any role defined by the client.

==== Full list of permissions

You can do a lot more with fine grain permissions beyond managing a specific client or the specific roles of a client.
This chapter defines the whole list of permission types that can be described for
a realm.

===== Role

When going to the `Permissions` tab for a specific role, you will see these
permission types listed.

map-role::
    Policies that decide if an admin can map this role to a user.  These policies
    only specify that the role can be mapped to a user, not that the admin is allowed
    to perform user role mapping tasks.  The admin will also have to have manage or
    role mapping permissions.  See <<_users-permissions, Users Permissions>> for more information.
map-role-composite::
    Policies that decide if an admin can map this role as a composite to another role.
    An admin can define roles for a client if he has to manage permissions for that client
    but he will not be able to add composites to those roles unless he has the
    `map-role-composite` privileges for the role he wants to add as a composite.
map-role-client-scope::
    Policies that decide if an admin can apply this role to the scope of a client.
    Even if the admin can manage the client, he will not have permission to
    create tokens for that client that contain this role unless this privilege
    is granted.

===== Client

When going to the `Permissions` tab for a specific client, you will see these
permission types listed.

view::
    Policies that decide if an admin can view the client's configuration.
manage::
    Policies that decide if an admin can view and manage the client's configuration.
    There are some issues with this in that privileges could be leaked unintentionally.
    For example, the admin could define a protocol mapper that hardcoded a role
    even if the admin does not have privileges to map the role to the client's scope.
    This is currently the limitation of protocol mappers as they don't have a way
    to assign individual permissions to them like roles do.
configure::
    Reduced set of privileges to manage the client.  It is like the `manage` scope except
    the admin is not allowed to define protocol mappers, change the client template,
    or the client's scope.
map-roles::
    Policies that decide if an admin can map any role defined by the client to a user.
    This is a shortcut, easy-of-use feature to avoid having to define policies
    for each and every role defined by the client.
map-roles-composite::
    Policies that decide if an admin can map any role defined by the client
    as a composite to another role.
    This is a shortcut, easy-of-use feature to avoid having to define policies
    for each and every role defined by the client.
map-roles-client-scope::
    Policies that decide if an admin can map any role defined by the client
    to the scope of another client.
    This is a shortcut, easy-of-use feature to avoid having to define policies
    for each and every role defined by the client.

[[_users-permissions]]
===== Users

When going to the `Permissions` tab for all users, you will see these
permission types listed.

view::
    Policies that decide if an admin can view all users in the realm.
manage::
    Policies that decide if an admin can manage all users in the realm.  This
    permission grants the admin the privilege to perform user role mappings, but
    it does not specify which roles the admin is allowed to map.  You'll need to
    define the privilege for each role you want the admin to be able to map.
map-roles::
    This is a subset of the privileges granted by the `manage` scope.  In this
    case the admin is only allowed to map roles.  The admin is not allowed to perform
    any other user management operation.  Also, like `manage`, the roles that the
    admin is allowed to apply must be specified per role or per set of roles if dealing
    with client roles.
manage-group-membership::
    Similar to `map-roles` except that it pertains to group membership: which
    groups a user can be added or removed from.  These
    policies just grant the admin permission to manage group membership, not which
    groups the admin is allowed to manage membership for.  You'll have to
    specify policies for each group's `manage-members` permission.
impersonate::
    Policies that decide if the admin is allowed to impersonate other users.  These
    policies are applied to the administrator's attributes and role mappings.
user-impersonated::
    Policies that decide which users can be impersonated.  These policies will be
    applied to the user being impersonated.  For example, you might want to define
    a policy that will forbid anybody from impersonating a user that has admin
    privileges.

===== Group

When going to the `Permissions` tab for a specific group, you will see these
permission types listed.

view::
    Policies that decide if the admin can view information about the group.
manage::
    Policies that decide if the admin can manage the configuration of the group.
view-members::
    Policies that decide if the admin can view the user details of members of the group.
manage-members::
    Policies that decide if the admin can manage the users that belong to this group.
manage-membership::
    Policies that decide if an admin can change the membership of the group.  Add or
    remove members from the group.
