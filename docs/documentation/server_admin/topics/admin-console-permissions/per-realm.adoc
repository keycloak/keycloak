[[_per_realm_admin_permissions]]

=== Dedicated realm admin consoles

Each realm has a dedicated Admin Console that can be accessed by going to the url `{kc_admins_path}/{realm-name}/console`.
Users within that realm can be granted realm management permissions by assigning specific user role mappings.

Each realm has a built-in client called `realm-management`.  You can view this client by going to the
`Clients` left menu item of your realm.  This client defines client-level roles that specify permissions that can be granted to manage the realm.

* view-realm
* view-users
* view-clients
* view-events
* manage-realm
* manage-users
* create-client
* manage-clients
* manage-events
* view-identity-providers
* manage-identity-providers
* impersonation

Assign the roles you want to your users and they will only be able to use that specific part of the administration console.
