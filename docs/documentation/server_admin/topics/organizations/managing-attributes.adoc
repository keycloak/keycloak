An administrator can store additional metadata about an organization using attributes. An organization attribute is a key/value pair that can hold multiple string values.

For that, click the *Attributes* tab and set any attribute you want by providing a key and a value.

To provide multiple values for the same attribute, and key, just add another attribute with the same key but with a different value.
