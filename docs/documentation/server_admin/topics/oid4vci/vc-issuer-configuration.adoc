== Configuring {project_name} as a Verifiable Credential Issuer

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is an experimental feature and should not be used in production. Backward compatibility is not guaranteed, and future updates may introduce breaking changes.
====

{project_name} provides experimental support for https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html[OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance].

=== Introduction

This chapter provides step-by-step instructions for configuring {project_name} as a Verifiable Credential Issuer using the OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) protocol. It outlines the process for setting up a {project_name} instance to securely issue and manage Verifiable Credentials (VCs), supporting decentralized identity solutions.

=== What are Verifiable Credentials (VCs)?

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are cryptographically signed, tamper-evident data structures that represent claims about an entity, such as a person, organization, or device. They are foundational to decentralized identity systems, allowing secure and privacy-preserving identity verification without reliance on centralized authorities. VCs support advanced features like selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs, enhancing user privacy and security.

=== What is OID4VCI?

OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) is an extension of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. It defines a standardized, interoperable framework for credential issuers to deliver VCs to holders, who can then present them to verifiers. OID4VCI leverages {project_name}'s existing authentication and authorization capabilities to streamline VC issuance.

=== Scope of This Chapter

This chapter covers the following technical configurations:

- Creating a dedicated realm for VC issuance.
- Setting up a test user for credential testing.
- Configuring custom cryptographic keys for signing and encrypting VCs.
- Defining realm attributes to specify VC metadata.
- Establishing client scopes and mappers to include user attributes in VCs.
- Registering a client to handle VC requests.
- Verifying the configuration using the issuer metadata endpoint.

=== Prerequisites

Ensure the following requirements are met before configuring {project_name} as a Verifiable Credential Issuer:

=== {project_name} Instance

A running {project_name} server with the OID4VCI feature enabled.

To enable the feature, add the following flag to the startup command:

[source,bash]
----
--features=oid4vc-vci
----

Verify activation by checking the server logs for the `OID4VC_VCI` initialization message.

=== Configuring Credential Issuance in Keycloak

In {project_name}, Verifiable Credentials are managed through *ClientScopes*, with each ClientScope representing a single Verifiable Credential type. To enable the issuance of a credential, the corresponding ClientScope must be assigned to an OpenID Connect client - ideally as *optional*.

During the OAuth2 authorization process, the credential-specific scope can be requested by including the ClientScope's name in the `scope` parameter of the authorization request. Once the user has successfully authenticated, the resulting Access Token *MUST* include the requested ClientScope in its `scope` claim. To ensure this, make sure the ClientScope option *Include in token scope* is enabled.

With this Access Token, the Verifiable Credential can be issued at the Credential Endpoint.

=== Authentication

An access token is required to authenticate API requests.

Refer to the following {project_name} documentation sections for detailed steps on:

- <<proc-creating-oidc-client_{context},Creating a Client>>
- <<_oidc-auth-flows-direct, Obtaining an Access Token>>

=== Configuration Steps

Follow these steps to configure {project_name} as a Verifiable Credential Issuer. Each section is detailed with procedures, explanations, and examples where applicable.

=== Creating a Realm

A realm in {project_name} is a logical container that manages users, clients, roles, and authentication flows.
For Verifiable Credential (VC) issuance, create a dedicated realm to ensure isolation and maintain a clear separation of functionality.

[NOTE]
====
For detailed instructions on creating a realm, refer to the {project_name} documentation:
<<proc-creating-a-realm_{context},Creating a Realm>>.
====

=== Creating a User Account

A test user is required to simulate credential issuance and verify the setup.

[NOTE]
====
For step-by-step instructions on creating a user, refer to the {project_name} documentation:
<<assembly-managing-users_{context},Creating a User>>.
====

Ensure that the user has a valid username, email, and password. If the password should not be reset upon first login, disable the "Temporary" toggle during password configuration.

=== Key Management Configuration

{project_name} uses cryptographic keys for signing and encrypting Verifiable Credentials (VCs). To ensure secure and standards-compliant issuance, configure **ECDSA (ES256) for signing**, **RSA (RS256) for signing**, and **RSA-OAEP for encryption** using a keystore.

[NOTE]
====
For a detailed guide on configuring realm keys, refer to the {project_name} documentation:
<<realm_keys,Managing Realm Keys>>.
====

==== Configuring Key Providers

To enable cryptographic operations for VC issuance:

- **ECDSA (ES256) Key**: Used for signing VCs with the ES256 algorithm.
- **RSA (RS256) Key**: Alternative signing mechanism using RS256.
- **RSA-OAEP Key**: Used for encrypting sensitive data in VCs.

Each key must be registered as a **java-keystore provider** within the **Realm Settings** > **Keys** section, ensuring:
- The keystore file is correctly specified and securely stored.
- The appropriate algorithm (ES256, RS256, or RSA-OAEP) is selected.
- The key is active, enabled, and configured with the correct usage (signing or encryption).
- Priority values are set to define precedence among keys.

[WARNING]
====
Ensure the keystore file is **securely stored** and accessible to the {project_name} server. Use **strong passwords** to protect both the keystore and the private keys.
====

=== Registering Realm Attributes

Realm attributes define metadata for Verifiable Credentials (VCs), such as **expiration times, supported formats, and scope definitions**. These attributes allow {project_name} to issue VCs with predefined settings.

Since the **{project_name} Admin Console does not support direct attribute creation**, use the **{project_name} Admin REST API** to configure these attributes.

==== Define Realm Attributes

Create a JSON file (e.g., `realm-attributes.json`) with the following content:

[source,json]
----
{
  "realm": "oid4vc-vci",
  "enabled": true,
  "attributes": {
    "preAuthorizedCodeLifespanS": 120
  }
}
----

==== Attribute Breakdown

The attributes section contains issuer-specific metadata:
- **preAuthorizedCodeLifespanS** – Defines how long pre-authorized codes remain valid (in seconds).

==== Import Realm Attributes

Use the following `curl` command to import the attributes into {project_name}:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT "https://localhost:8443/admin/realms/oid4vc-vci" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @realm-attributes.json
----

[NOTE]
====
- Replace `$ACCESS_TOKEN` with a valid **{project_name} Admin API access token**.
- **Avoid using `-k` in production**; instead, configure a **trusted TLS certificate**.
====

=== Create Client Scopes with Mappers

Client scopes define **which user attributes** are included in Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Therefore, they are considered the Verifiable Credential configuration itself. These scopes use **protocol mappers** to map specific claims into VCs and the protocol mappers will also contain the corresponding metadata for claims that is displayed at the Credential Issuer Metadata Endpoint.

You can create the ClientScopes using the {project_name} web Administration Console, but the web Administration Console does not yet support adding metadata configuration. For metadata configuration, you will need to use the Admin REST API.

==== Define a Client Scope with a Mapper

Create a JSON file (e.g., `client-scopes.json`) with the following content:

[source,json]
----

  "name": "vc-scope-mapping",
  "protocol": "oid4vc",
  "attributes": {

      "protocolMapper": "oid4vc-static-claim-mapper",
      "config": {
        "claim.name": "academic_title",
        "staticValue": "N/A"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "givenName",
      "protocol": "oid4vc",
      "protocolMapper": "oid4vc-user-attribute-mapper",
      "config": {

      }
    }
  ]
}
----

[NOTE]
====
This is a **sample configuration**.
You can define **additional protocol mappers** to support different claim mappings, such as:

- Dynamic attribute values instead of static ones.
- Mapping multiple attributes per credential type.
- Alternative supported credential types.
====

From the example above:

- It is important to set `include.in.token.scope=true`, see <<include.in.token.scope, Attribute table: include.in.token.scope>>.
- Most of the named attributes above are optional. See below: <<client-scope-attribute-breakdown,Attribute Breakdown>>.
- You can determine the appropriate `protocolMapper` names by first creating them through the Web Administration Console and then retrieving their definitions via the Admin REST API.

==== Import the Client Scope

Use the following `curl` command to import the client scope into {project_name}:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://localhost:8443/admin/realms/oid4vc-vci/client-scopes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

- If updating an existing scope, use `PUT` instead of `POST`.
====

=== Create the Client

Set up a client to handle Verifiable Credential (VC) requests and assign the necessary scopes.
The client does not differ from regular OpenID Connect clients — with one exception: it must have the appropriate **optional ClientScopes** assigned that define the Verifiable Credentials it is allowed to issue.

. Create a JSON file (e.g., `oid4vc-rest-api-client.json`) with the following content:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "clientId": "oid4vc-rest-api",
  "enabled": true,
  "protocol": "openid-connect",
  "publicClient": false,
  "serviceAccountsEnabled": true,
  "clientAuthenticatorType": "client-secret",
  "redirectUris": ["http://localhost:8080/*"],
  "directAccessGrantsEnabled": true,
  "defaultClientScopes": ["profile"],
  "optionalClientScopes": ["vc-scope-mapping"],
  "attributes": {
    "client.secret.creation.time": "1719785014",
    "client.introspection.response.allow.jwt.claim.enabled": "false",
    "login_theme": "keycloak",
    "post.logout.redirect.uris": "http://localhost:8080"
  }
}
----
+
- **clientId**: Unique identifier for the client.
- **optionalClientScopes**: Links the `vc-scope-mapping` scope for VC requests.

. Import the client using the following `curl` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -k -X POST "https://localhost:8443/admin/realms/oid4vc-vci/clients" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @oid4vc-rest-api-client.json
----

=== Verify the Configuration

Validate the setup by accessing the **issuer metadata endpoint**:

. Open a browser or use a tool like `curl` to visit:
+
[source,bash]
----
https://localhost:8443/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer/realms/oid4vc-vci
----

A successful response returns a JSON object containing details such as:
- **Supported claims**
- **Credential formats**
- **Issuer metadata**

=== Conclusion

You have successfully configured **{project_name} as a Verifiable Credential Issuer** using the **OID4VCI protocol**.
This setup leverages {project_name}'s robust **identity management capabilities** to issue secure, **standards-compliant VCs**.
