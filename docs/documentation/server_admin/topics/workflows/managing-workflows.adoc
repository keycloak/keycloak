Workflows can be managed through the Admin Console or the Admin REST API.

== Managing workflows through the Admin Console

To manage workflows through the Admin Console, you can follow these steps:

.Procedure

. Click *Workflows* in the menu.

.Empty workflows list

If your realm does not have any workflows defined yet, you will see an empty list. To create a new workflow, click *Create*.

. Creating a new workflow
image:images/workflows-create.png[alt="Creating a new workflow"]

This will open the workflow creation screen where you can define the workflow using YAML format. To save the workflow, click *Save*.

Once you have created one or more workflows, they will be listed in the workflows list.

.List of workflows

From the workflows list, you can perform the following actions:

*   **Create**: Click *Create workflow* to create a new workflow.
*   **Update**: Click on the name of an existing workflow to update it.
*   **Enable/Disable**: Use the toggle button on the *Status* column to enable or disable a workflow.
*   **Copy**: Click on the *Copy* button next to a workflow to create a copy of it. This is useful if you want to create a new workflow based on an existing one.
*   **Delete**: Click on the *Delete* button next to a workflow to delete it.

=== Updating a workflow

To update a workflow, click on its name in the workflows list. This will open the workflow in edit mode, where you can modify its YAML definition.
After making your changes, click *Save* to apply the updates.

There are limitations when updating workflows if they have scheduled steps. In such cases, you are not able to change the step chain of a workflow
if there are active instances of the workflow being updated. This limitation is in place to ensure the integrity of ongoing workflow instances
where updates to the step chain could lead to an expensive operation of migrating existing instances to the new step chain,
which could impact system performance as well as lead to inconsistencies and an unexpected behavior.

In future releases, we plan to introduce a more flexible approach to updating workflows with scheduled steps, so that administrators
are going to be allowed to migrate realm resources scheduled for a specific step to a different step in the updated workflow.

For now, the only option is to either wait for all active instances to complete or to delete the workflow and create a new one.
Note that deleting a workflow will also delete all its active instances, therefore, realm resources associated with those instances
will not be processed further, and they would need to be re-associated with a new workflow instance if needed.
