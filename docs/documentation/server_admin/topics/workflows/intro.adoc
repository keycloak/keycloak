{project_name} Workflows is a powerful engine to automate and orchestrate realm administrative tasks, bringing key
capabilities of Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) to your identity and access management infrastructure.
By using workflows, you can implement policies and processes that govern the lifecycle of realm resources, such as users and clients,
helping you to improve security, meet compliance requirements, and reduce administrative costs.

As a core component of IGA, identity lifecycle management is fully supported by workflows so that you can easily automate
onboarding and offboarding processes, and other recurring administrative tasks. For example, you can define workflows to:

* Provision and de-provision realm resources, such as users, automatically based on specific events or conditions.
* Automate Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML) processes to ensure that users are granted the appropriate access rights based on their roles and responsibilities.
* Enforce access reviews and certifications to ensure that users have the appropriate access rights.
* Enforce Just-In-Time and Least Privilege access by automating role assignments and revocations.
* Enforce strong authentication policies for realm users.
* Prevent insider data breaches by automating the removal of inactive or obsolete users.

By leveraging workflows, realm administrators can ensure that security policies are consistently enforced and based on
the least privilege principle, reduce the risk of human error, and free up valuable time to focus on other important administrative tasks.
This guide will walk you through the process of creating and managing workflows to automate your administrative tasks
and implement IGA best practices when managing realms.
