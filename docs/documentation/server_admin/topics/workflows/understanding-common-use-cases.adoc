Workflows can be used to automate a wide range of administrative tasks within a realm. Here are some common use cases where workflows can be particularly beneficial:

== User Onboarding

When a new user is created, a workflow can automatically send a welcome email, and assign initial roles or groups to the user. This ensures that new users have the necessary access and information from the moment they join.

```yaml
name: Onboarding gold members
on: user-created
if: has-user-attribute('membership','gold')
steps:
  - uses: notify-user
    with:
      message: "Welcome to the Gold Membership program!"
  - uses: grant-role
    with:
      role: gold-member
```

== User Offboarding

When a user is removed from a specific group, a workflow can automatically revoke certain roles or permissions associated with that group.

```yaml
name: Offboarding sales members
on: user_group_membership_removed('/Sales')
steps:
  - uses: revoke-role
    with:
      role: "manager,sales-rep,sales-intern"
```

== Tracking user activity and taking actions on inactivity

When a user has been inactive for a certain period, a workflow can send reminder emails and deactivate the account.

```yaml
name: Track inactive users
on: user_authenticated
concurrency:
  restart-in-progress: true
steps:
  - uses: notify-user
    after: 180d
    with:
      message: It has been a while since your last login. We miss you!
  - uses: notify-user
    after: 60d
    with:
      message: Your account will be disabled in ${workflow.daysUntilNextStep} days!
  - uses: disable-user
    after: 7d
  - uses: notify-user
    with:
      message: Your account was disabled. Sorry to see you go.
```
