=== OpenID Federation
[role="_abstract"]
link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html[OpenID Federation] offers a robust framework for establishing dynamic trust between OpenID Providers (OPs, Identity Providers in Keycloak) and Relying Parties (RPs, Clients in Keycloak) via Trust Anchors(TA), significantly simplifying the management of large-scale identity federations.
This eliminates the need for cumbersome manual or bilateral trust agreements.
OpenID Federation uses link:https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/[OpenID Connect] and link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0] flows and contexts.
Basic goal is to support Keycloak being member in an OpenID Federation as OP and RP.
link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html#name-openid-connect-client-regis[Client Registration] can be done via automatic, without client registration, and via explicit, automatic client registration.
https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html[OpenID Federation] defines also other entity types such as Trust Anchor, Intermediate Entity, Trust Marks, OAuth entities.


OpenID Federation is experimental and it is disabled by default in a realm.
Keycloak supports only being OP with explicit registration without Metadata Policies support, receiving Entity Statement.
You need to enable OpenID Federation with required attributes and define at least one Federation(Trust Anchor) to be member of.
A realm can be member in multiple Federation(Trust Anchor) with different configuration.
This will enable link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html[a signed JWT Federation Entity Configuration] from `<root>/realms/{realm-name}/.well-known/openid-federation`.
After you need to enroll your Keycloak realm in the configured Trust Anchor in order to be able to accept client explicit registrations, via federation registration endpoint (`<root>/realms/{realm-name}/openid-federation/clients-registrations` that is shown also in OpenID Federation Entity Configuration.
OpenID Federation access policies can be defined, without enabling any by default.
