= Enabling reCAPTCHA

[role="_abstract"]
To safeguard registration against bots, {project_name} has integration with Google reCAPTCHA (see <<procedure_recaptcha>>), hCaptcha (see <<procedure_hcaptcha>>), and reCAPTCHA Enterprise (see <<procedure_recaptcha_enterprise>>).
The default theme (`register.ftl`) supports both v2 (visible, checkbox-based) and v3 (score-based, invisible) reCAPTCHA (see https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha/docs/choose-key-type[Choose the appropriate reCAPTCHA key type]).
