= Enabling reCAPTCHA

[role="_abstract"]
To safeguard registration against bots, {project_name} has integration with Google reCAPTCHA (see <<procedure_recaptcha>>) and reCAPTCHA Enterprise (see <<procedure_recaptcha_enterprise>>).
The default theme (`register.ftl`) supports both v2 (visible, checkbox-based) and v3 (score-based, invisible) reCAPTCHA (see https://docs.cloud.google.com/recaptcha/docs/choose-key-type[Choose the appropriate reCAPTCHA key type]).

[[procedure_recaptcha]]
== Setting up Google reCAPTCHA

. Enter the following URL in a browser:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create
----

. Create a reCAPTCHA and choose between Challenge v2 (visible checkbox) or Score-based, v3 (invisible) to get your reCAPTCHA site key and secret. Note them down for future use in this procedure.
+
NOTE: localhost domains are not supported by default. If you wish to continue supporting them for development you can add them to the list of supported domains for your site key.
+
. Navigate to the {project_name} admin console.
. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *Flows* tab.

.. Toggle **reCAPTCHA v3** according to your Site Key type: on for score-based reCAPTCHA (v3), off for challenge reCAPTCHA (v2).

. Authorize Google to use the registration page as an iframe.
+
NOTE: In {project_name}, websites cannot include a login page dialog in an iframe. This restriction is to prevent clickjacking attacks. You need to change the default HTTP response headers that is set in {project_name}.
+
.. Click *Realm Settings* in the menu.
.. Click the *Security Defenses* tab.
.. Enter `https://www.google.com` in the field for the *X-Frame-Options* header (or `https//www.recaptcha.net` if you enabled *Use recaptcha.net*).

+
. On your Google Cloud Project, go to *Credentials* and create an API key.
+
NOTE: For better security, click on *edit api key* and add an API restriction to restrict the key to the *reCAPTCHA Enterprise API* only.
