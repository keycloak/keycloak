= Creating an OTP

[role="_abstract"]
If OTP is conditional in your realm, the user must navigate to {project_name} Account Console to reconfigure a new OTP generator. If OTP is required, then the user must reconfigure a new OTP generator when logging in. 

Alternatively, you can send an email to the user that requests the user reset the OTP generator. The following procedure also applies if the user already has an OTP credential.

. Select a user.
. Click the *Credentials* tab.
. Click *Credential Reset*.
. Set *Reset Actions* to *Configure OTP*. 
. Click *Send Email*. The sent email contains a link that directs the user to the *OTP setup page*.
