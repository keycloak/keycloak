= Impersonating a user

An administrator with the appropriate permissions can impersonate a user. For example, if a user experiences a bug in an application, an administrator can impersonate the user to investigate or duplicate the issue. 

Any user with the `impersonation` role in the realm can impersonate a user. 

.Procedure
. Click *Users* in the menu.
. Click a user to impersonate.
. From the *Actions* list, select *Impersonate*.

* If the administrator and the user are in the same realm, then the administrator will be logged out and automatically logged in as the user being impersonated.
* If the administrator and user are in different realms, the administrator will remain logged in, and additionally will be logged in as the user in that user's realm.

In both instances, the *Account Console* of the impersonated user is displayed.
