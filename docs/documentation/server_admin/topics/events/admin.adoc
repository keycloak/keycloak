=== Auditing admin events

You can record all actions that are performed by an administrator in the Admin Console. The Admin Console performs administrative actions by invoking the {project_name} REST interface and {project_name} audits these REST invocations. You can view the resulting events in the Admin Console.

.Procedure

When the `Include Representation` switch is ON, it can lead to storing a lot of information in the database. You can set a maximum length of the representation by using the `+--spi-events-store--jpa--max-field-length+` argument. This setting is useful if you want to adhere to the underlying storage limitation. For example:

[source,bash]
----
kc.[sh|bat] --spi-events-store--jpa--max-field-length=2500
----
