=== Auditing user events

You can record and view every event that affects users. {project_name} triggers login events for actions such as successful user login, a user entering an incorrect password, or a user account updating. By default, {project_name} does not store or display events in the Admin Console. Only the error events are logged to the Admin Console and the server’s log file.

.Procedure

Use this procedure to start auditing user events.

. Click *Realm settings* in the menu.
. Click the *Events* tab.

[[event-listener]]
==== Event listener

Event listeners listen for events and perform actions based on that event. {project_name} includes two built-in listeners, the Logging Event Listener and Email Event Listener.

===== The logging event listener
When the Logging Event Listener is enabled, this listener writes to a log file when an error event occurs.

An example log message from a Logging Event Listener:

----
11:36:09,965 WARN  [org.keycloak.events] (default task-51) type=LOGIN_ERROR, realmId=master,
                    clientId=myapp,
                    userId=19aeb848-96fc-44f6-b0a3-59a17570d374, ipAddress=127.0.0.1,
                    error=invalid_user_credentials, auth_method=openid-connect, auth_type=code,
                    redirect_uri=http://localhost:8180/myapp,
                    code_id=b669da14-cdbb-41d0-b055-0810a0334607, username=admin
----

You can use the Logging Event Listener to protect against hacker bot attacks:

. Parse the log file for the `LOGIN_ERROR` event.
. Extract the IP Address of the failed login event.
. Send the IP address to an intrusion prevention software framework tool.

The Logging Event Listener logs events to the `org.keycloak.events` log category. {project_name} does not include debug log events in server logs, by default.

To include debug log events in server logs:

. Change the log level for the `org.keycloak.events` category
. Change the log level used by the Logging Event listener.

To change the log level used by the Logging Event listener, add the following:

[source,bash]
----
bin/kc.[sh|bat] start --spi-events-listener-jboss-logging-success-level=info --spi-events-listener-jboss-logging-error-level=error
----

The valid values for log levels are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`.

===== The Email Event Listener

The Email Event Listener sends an email to the user's account when an event occurs and supports the following events:

* Login Error.
* Update Password.
* Update Time-based One-time Password (TOTP).
* Remove Time-based One-time Password (TOTP).

.Procedure

To enable the Email Listener:

. Click *Realm settings* in the menu.
. Click the *Events* tab.
. Click the *Event listeners* field.
. Select `email`.

You can exclude events by using the `--spi-events-listener-email-exclude-events` argument. For example:

[source,bash]
----
kc.[sh|bat] --spi-events-listener-email-exclude-events=UPDATE_TOTP,REMOVE_TOTP
----
