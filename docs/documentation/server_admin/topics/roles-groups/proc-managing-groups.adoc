Groups in {project_name} manage a common set of attributes and role mappings for each user. Users can be members of any number of groups and inherit the attributes and role mappings assigned to each group.

To manage groups, click *Groups* in the menu.

Groups are hierarchical. A group can have multiple subgroups but a group can have only one parent. Subgroups inherit the attributes and role mappings from their parent. Users inherit the attributes and role mappings from their parent as well.

If you have a parent group and a child group, and a user that belongs only to the child group, the user in the child group inherits the attributes and role mappings of both the parent group and the child group.

The hierarchy of a group is sometimes represented using the group path. The path is the complete list of names that represents the hierarchy of a specific group, from top to bottom and separated by slashes `/` (similar to files in a File System). For example a path can be `/top/level1/level2` which means that `top` is a top level group and is parent of `level1`, which in turn is parent of `level2`. This path represents unambiguously the hierarchy for the group `level2`.

Because of historical reasons {project_name}, does not escape slashes in the group name itself. Therefore a group named `level1/group` under `top` uses the path `/top/level1/group`, which is misleading. {project_name} can be started with the option `+--spi-group--jpa--escape-slashes-in-group-path+` to `true` and then the slashes in the name are escaped with the character `~`. The escape char marks that the slash is part of the name and has no hierarchical meaning. The previous path example would be `/top/level1~/group` when escaped.
