[[_jwe-id-token-encryption]]
*Signed and Encrypted ID Token Support*

{project_name} can encrypt ID tokens according to the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516[Json Web Encryption (JWE)] specification. The administrator determines if ID tokens are encrypted for each client.

The key used for encrypting the ID token is the Content Encryption Key (CEK). {project_name} and a client must negotiate which CEK is used and how it is delivered. The method used to determine the CEK is the Key Management Mode. The Key Management Mode that {project_name} supports is Key Encryption.

In Key Encryption:

. The client generates an asymmetric cryptographic key pair.
. The public key is used to encrypt the CEK.
. {project_name} generates a CEK per ID token
. {project_name} encrypts the ID token using this generated CEK
. {project_name} encrypts the CEK using the client's public key.
. The client decrypts this encrypted CEK using their private key
. The client decrypts the ID token using the decrypted CEK.

No party, other than the client, can decrypt the ID token.

The client must pass its public key for encrypting CEK to {project_name}. {project_name} supports downloading public keys from a URL provided by the client. The client must provide public keys according to the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517[Json Web Keys (JWK)] specification.

The procedure is:

. Open the client's *Keys* tab.
. Toggle *JWKS URL* to ON.
. Input the client's public key URL in the *JWKS URL* textbox.

Key Encryption's algorithms are defined in the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.1[Json Web Algorithm (JWA)] specification. {project_name} supports:

* RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5(RSA1_5)
* RSAES OAEP using default parameters (RSA-OAEP)
* RSAES OAEP 256 using SHA-256 and MFG1 (RSA-OAEP-256)

The procedure to select the algorithm is:

. Open the client's *Advanced* tab.
. Open *Fine Grain OpenID Connect Configuration*.
. Select the algorithm from *ID Token Encryption Content Encryption Algorithm* pulldown menu.

[[_mtls-client-certificate-bound-tokens]]
*OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Certificate Bound Access Tokens Enabled*

Mutual TLS binds an access token and a refresh token together with a client certificate, which is exchanged during a TLS handshake. This binding prevents an attacker from using stolen tokens.

This type of token is a holder-of-key token. Unlike bearer tokens, the recipient of a holder-of-key token can verify if the sender of the token is legitimate.

If this setting is on, the workflow is:

. A token request is sent to the token endpoint in an authorization code flow or hybrid flow.
. {project_name} requests a client certificate.
. {project_name} receives the client certificate.
. {project_name} successfully verifies the client certificate.

If verification fails, {project_name} rejects the token.

In the following cases, {project_name} will verify the client sending the access token or the refresh token:

* A token refresh request is sent to the token endpoint with a holder-of-key refresh token.
* A UserInfo request is sent to UserInfo endpoint with a holder-of-key access token.
* A logout request is sent to non-OIDC compliant {project_name} proprietary Logout endpoint with a holder-of-key refresh token.

See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls-08#section-3[Mutual TLS Client Certificate Bound Access Tokens] in the OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Authentication and Certificate Bound Access Tokens for more details.

[NOTE]
====
{project_name} client adapters do not support holder-of-key token verification. {project_name} adapters treat access and refresh tokens as bearer tokens.
====

[[_dpop-bound-tokens]]
*OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)*

DPoP binds an access token and a refresh token together with the public part of a client's key pair. This binding prevents an attacker from using stolen tokens.

This type of token is a holder-of-key token. Unlike bearer tokens, the recipient of a holder-of-key token can verify if the sender of the token is legitimate.

If the client switch `Require DPoP bound tokens` is on (*Settings tab*, section *Capability config*), the workflow is:

. A token request is sent to the token endpoint in an authorization code flow or hybrid flow.
. {project_name} requests a DPoP proof.
. {project_name} receives the DPoP proof.
. {project_name} successfully verifies the DPoP proof.

If verification fails, {project_name} rejects the token.

If the switch `Require DPoP bound tokens` is off, the client can still send `DPoP` proof in the token request. In that case, {project_name} will verify DPoP proof
and will add the thumbprint to the token. But if the switch is off, DPoP binding is not enforced by the {project_name} server for this client. It is recommended to have this switch
on if you want to make sure that particular client always uses DPoP binding.

In the following cases, {project_name} will verify the client sending the access token or the refresh token:

* A token refresh request is sent to the token endpoint with a holder-of-key refresh token. This verification is done only for public clients as described in the DPoP specification. For confidential clients, the verification is not done as client authentication with proper client credentials is in place to ensure that request comes from the legitimate client. For public clients, both access tokens and refresh tokens are DPoP bound. For confidential clients, only access tokens are DPoP bound.
* A UserInfo request is sent to UserInfo endpoint with a holder-of-key access token.
* A logout request is sent to a non-OIDC compliant {project_name} proprietary logout endpoint Logout endpoint with a holder-of-key refresh token. This verification is done only for public clients as described above.

See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449[OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP)] for more details.

[NOTE]
====
{project_name} client adapters do not support DPoP holder-of-key token verification. {project_name} adapters treat access and refresh tokens as bearer tokens.

[[_client_advanced_settings_oidc]]
*Advanced Settings for OIDC*

The Advanced Settings for OpenID Connect allows you to configure overrides at the client level for <<_timeouts, session and token timeouts>>.

image:images/client-advanced-settings-oidc.png[Advanced Settings]

|===
|Configuration|Description

|Access Token Lifespan
|The value overrides the realm option with same name.

|Client Session Idle
|The value overrides the realm option with same name. The value should be shorter than the global *SSO Session Idle*.

|Client Session Max
|The value overrides the realm option with same name. The value should be shorter than the global *SSO Session Max*.

|Client Offline Session Idle
|This setting allows you to configure a shorter offline session idle timeout for the client. The timeout is amount of time the session remains idle before {project_name} revokes its offline token. If not set, realm <<_offline-session-idle,Offline Session Idle>> is used.

|Client Offline Session Max
|This setting allows you to configure a shorter offline session max lifespan for the client. The lifespan is the maximum time before {project_name} revokes the corresponding offline token. This option needs <<_offline-session-max-limited,Offline Session Max Limited>> enabled globally in the realm, and defaults to <<_offline-session-max,Offline Session Max>>.

[[_proof-key-for-code-exchange]]
*Proof Key for Code Exchange Code Challenge Method*

If an attacker steals an authorization code of a legitimate client, Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) prevents the attacker from receiving the tokens that apply to the code.

An administrator can select one of these options:

*(blank)*:: {project_name} does not apply PKCE unless the client sends appropriate PKCE parameters to {project_name}s authorization endpoint.
*S256*:: {project_name} applies to the client PKCE whose code challenge method is S256.
*plain*:: {project_name} applies to the client PKCE whose code challenge method is plain.

See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636[RFC 7636 Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients] for more details.

[[_mapping-acr-to-loa-client]]
*ACR to Level of Authentication (LoA) Mapping*

In the advanced settings of a client, you can define which `Authentication Context Class Reference (ACR)` value is mapped to which `Level of Authentication (LoA)`.
This mapping can be specified also at the realm as mentioned in the <<_mapping-acr-to-loa-realm,ACR to LoA Mapping>>. A best practice is to configure this mapping at the
realm level, which allows to share the same settings across multiple clients.

The `Default ACR Values` can be used to specify the default values when the login request is sent from this client to {project_name} without `acr_values` parameter and without
a `claims` parameter that has an `acr` claim attached. See https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata[official OIDC dynamic client registration specification].

WARNING: Note that default ACR values are used as the default level, however it cannot be reliably used to enforce login with the particular level.
For example, assume that you configure the `Default ACR Values` to level 2. Then by default, users will be required to authenticate with level 2.
However, when the user explicitly attaches the parameter into login request such as `acr_values=1`, then the level 1 will be used. As a result, if the client
really requires level 2, the client is encouraged to check the presence of the `acr` claim inside ID Token and double-check that it contains the requested level 2.
To actually enforce the usage of a certain ACR on the {project_name} side, use the `Minimum ACR Value` setting.
This allows administrators to enforce ACRs even on applications that are not able to validate the requested `acr` claim inside the token.
