== Enabling Remember Me

A logged-in user closing their browser destroys their session, and that user must log in again. You can set {project_name} to keep the user's login session open if that user clicks the _Remember Me_ checkbox upon login. This action turns the login cookie from a session-only cookie to a persistence cookie.

.Procedure
. Click *Realm settings* in the menu.
. Click the *Login* tab.
. Toggle the *Remember Me* switch to *On*.

WARNING: Note that disabling the "Remember me" option will invalidate all sessions created with the "Remember me" checkbox selected during login, requiring users to log in again. Any refresh tokens related to these sessions will also become invalid.
Note also that the sessions will not be invalidated immediately when the switch is disabled, but only when a cookie or token associated with an invalid session is used. This means that disabling and then re-enabling the "Remember me" switch cannot be used to invalidate old sessions.
