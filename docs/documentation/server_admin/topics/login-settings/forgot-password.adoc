== Enabling forgot password

. Specify `Host` and `From` in the *Email* tab in order for {Project_Name} to be able to send the reset email.

The text sent in the email is configurable. See link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information.

When users click the email link, {project_name} asks them to update their password, and if they have set up an OTP generator, {project_name} asks them to reconfigure the OTP generator.  Depending on security requirements of your organization, you may not want users to reset their OTP generator through email. 

To change this behavior, perform these steps:

.Procedure
. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *Flows* tab.
. Select the *Reset Credentials* flow.

. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *Required actions* tab.
. Ensure *Update Password* is enabled.
