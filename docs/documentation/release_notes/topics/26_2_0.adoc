= Additional query parameters in Admin Events API

The Admin Events API now supports filtering for events based on Epoc timestamps in addition to the previous
`yyyy-MM-dd` format. This provides more fine-grained control of the window of events to retrieve.

A `direction` query parameter was also added, allowing controlling the order of returned items as `asc` or
`desc`. In the past the events where always returned in `desc` order (most recent events first).

Finally, the returned event representations now also include the `id`, which provides a unique identifier for
an event.

= New cache for CRLs loaded for the X.509 authenticator

Now the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL), that are used to validate certificates in the X.509 authenticator, are cached inside a new infinispan cache called `crl`. Caching improves the validation performance and decreases the memory consumption because just one CRL is maintained per source.

Check the `crl-storage` section in the link:https://www.keycloak.org/server/all-provider-config[All provider configuration] {section} to know the options for the new cache provider.

= Dynamic Authentication Flow selection using Client Policies

Introduced the ability to dynamically select authentication flows based on conditions such as requested scopes, ACR (Authentication Context Class Reference) and others.
This can be achieved using link:{adminguide_link}#_client_policies[Client Policies] by combining the new `AuthenticationFlowSelectorExecutor` with conditions like the new `ACRCondition`. For more details, see the link:{adminguide_link}#_client-policy-auth-flow[{adminguide_name}].

= Logs support ECS format

All available log handlers now support *ECS* (Elastic Common Schema) JSON format.
It helps to improve {project_name}'s observability story and centralized logging.

For more details, see the https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging[Logging guide].
