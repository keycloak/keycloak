= Organization invitation management

Organization administrators can now manage organization invitations through both the Admin Console and REST API:

* View all sent invitations with their current status (Pending, Expired)
* Resend pending invitations to recipients
* Delete invitation records from the system
* Filter invitations by status for easier management

All invitations are now persistently stored in the database, providing better tracking and management capabilities.

The invitation management features are available in the *Invitations* tab when managing an organization in the Admin Console, and through the Organizations REST API endpoints under `/admin/realms/{realm}/orgs/{orgId}/invitations`.
