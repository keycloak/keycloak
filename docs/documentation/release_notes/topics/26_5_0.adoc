= Better HTTP performance

You can now enable a more efficient way to handle JSON data in the HTTP layer.
This change increases throughput by ~5%, stabilizes response times, and reduces system resource usage.

In order to apply it, you need to explicitly enable the feature `http-optimized-serializers`.

NOTE: This feature is *preview*.
