= Preview of enhanced HTTP performance

You can now enable a more efficient way to handle JSON data in the HTTP layer.
This change increases throughput by ~5%, stabilizes response times, and reduces system resource usage.

In order to apply it, you need to explicitly enable the feature `http-optimized-serializers`.

NOTE: This feature is *preview*.

= Breaking Fix for Windows in Loopback Hostname Verification

This release introduces a breaking change for Windows users: setups that previously relied on custom machine names or non-standard hostnames for loopback (e.g., `127.0.0.1` resolving to a custom name) may require updates to their trusted domain configuration. Only `localhost` and `*.localhost` are now recognized for loopback verification.

Keycloak now consistently normalizes loopback addresses to `localhost` for domain verification across all platforms. This change ensures predictable behavior for trusted domain checks, regardless of the underlying OS.

= Export traces with custom request headers

It is now possible to set request headers for exporting traces via Open Telemetry Protocol (OTLP).
It is mainly useful for providing tokens in the request.

You can specify these headers via the `tracing-header-<header>` wildcard option, accepting any custom header name.

For more details, see the  link:{tracingguide_link}[{tracingguide_name}] guide.
