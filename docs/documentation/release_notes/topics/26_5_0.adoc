== Breaking Fix for Windows in Loopback Hostname Verification

This release introduces a breaking change for Windows users: setups that previously relied on custom machine names or non-standard hostnames for loopback (e.g., `127.0.0.1` resolving to a custom name) may require updates to their trusted domain configuration. Only `localhost` and `*.localhost` are now recognized for loopback verification.

Keycloak now consistently normalizes loopback addresses to `localhost` for domain verification across all platforms. This change ensures predictable behavior for trusted domain checks, regardless of the underlying OS.
