= Better HTTP performance

For the HTTP layer, you can now use Jackson JSON reflection-free serializers, improving request handling efficiency.
This change increases throughput by ~5%, stabilizes response times, and reduces system resource usage.

In order to apply it, you need to explicitly enable the feature `http-optimized-serializers`.

NOTE: This feature is *preview* as we gather more feedback about potential issues. We appreciate any feedback.
