= Supported user profile and progressive profiling

The user profile preview feature is promoted to be fully supported and user profile is enabled by default!

In the past months, Keycloak team spent a huge amount of effort in polishing the user
profile feature to make it fully supported. In this release, we continued the effort. Lots of improvements, fixes and
polishing were done based on the thorough testing and feedback from our awesome community.

Few highlights of the user profile feature:
* Fine-grained control over the attributes that users and administrators can manage so that you can prevent unexpected attributes, and values, from being set. 
* Ability to specify what user attributes are managed and should be displayed on the forms to regular users or administrators

* Dynamic forms - Previously, the forms where users created or updated their profiles, contain four basic attributes like username, email, first name and last name. Any additional
attributes (or removing some of the default attributes) required to create custom theme. Now custom themes may no longer be needed because users see exactly the requested attributes based on the requirement
of the particular deployment

* Validations - Ability to specify validators for the user attributes including built-in validators that you can use to specify a maximum or minimum length, a specific regex, or limiting a  
particular attribute to be a URL or number.

* Annotations - Ability to specify that particular attribute should be rendered for instance as text area or HTML select with specified options or calendar and lots of other options. You can also bind JavaScript code to a specific field to change how an attribute is rendered and customize its behavior.

* Progressive profiling - Ability to specify that some fields are required or available on the forms just for particular values of `scope` parameter. This effectively allow progressive
profiling. You no longer need to ask the user for twenty attributes during registration; you can instead ask the user to fill in attributes incrementally according to the requirements of the individual client
applications that are used by the user.

* Migration from previous versions - User profile is now always enabled, but it operates as before for those who did not use this feature previously. You can
benefit from the user profile capabilities, but you are not strictly forced to use them. For migration instructions consult the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

This first release of the user profile as a supported feature is just the starting point and the baseline for delivering many more capabilities around identity management.

== Breaking changes to the User Profile SPI

In this release, changes to the User Profile SPI might impact existing implementations based on this SPI. For more details, check the
link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

== Changes to Freemarker templates to allow rendering pages based on the user profile configuration set to a realm

In this release, the following templates were updated to make it possible to dynamically render attributes based
on the user profile configuration set to a realm:

* `login-update-profile.ftl`
* `register.ftl`
* `update-email.ftl`

For more details, see link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

== The update profile page when logging in for the first time through a broker now has its own Freemarker templates

In this release, the server renders the update profile page when the user is authenticating through a broker for the
first time using the `idp-review-user-profile.ftl` template.

For more details, see link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Java adapter deprecation and removal

Back in 2022 we announced the https://www.keycloak.org/2022/02/adapter-deprecation.html[deprecation of Keycloak adapters in Keycloak 19].
To give the community more time to adopt this https://www.keycloak.org/2023/03/adapter-deprecation-update.html[was delayed].

With that in mind this will be the last major release of Keycloak to include OpenID Connect and SAML adapters.
As Jetty 9.x has not been supported since 2022 the Jetty adapter has been removed already in this release.

The generic Authorization Client library will continue to be supported, and aims to be used in combination with any
other OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect libraries.

The only adapter we will continue to deliver is the SAML adapter for latest releases of WildFly and EAP 8.x. Reasoning
for continuing to support this is down to the fact that the majority of the SAML codebase in Keycloak was a contribution
from WildFly. As part of this contribution we agreed to maintain SAML adapters for WildFly and EAP in the long run.

== Jetty adapter removed

Jetty 9.4 has not been supported in the community for a long time, and reached end-of-life in 2022. At the same time the
adapter has not been updated or tested with more recent versions of Jetty. For these reasons the Jetty adapter has been
removed from this release.

= New Welcome Page

The 'welcome' page that is shown when a user starts Keycloak for the first time, has been redesigned to provide a better setup experience and has been upgraded to the latest version of https://www.patternfly.org/[PatternFly]. The page layout has been simplified and now includes only a form to register the administrative user. After completing the registration, the user is redirected directly to the Administration Console.

image::images/new-welcome-screen.png["A screenshot of the new welcome page, showing a simplified layout with a user registration form."]

If you are using a custom theme, you may need to update it to support the new welcome page. For more details, see the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= New Account Console now the default

We introduced version 3 of the Account Console in Keycloak 22 as a preview feature. In this release, we are making it the default version, and deprecating version 2 in the process, which will be removed in a subsequent release.

This new version has built-in support for the user profile feature, which allows administrators to configure which attributes are available to users in the Account Console, and lands a user directly on their personal account page after logging in:
.New Account Console with custom attributes
image::images/new-account-console.png["New Account Console with custom attributes"]

If you are using or extending the customization features of this theme,  you may need to perform additional migrations. For more details, see the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Keycloak JS

== Using `exports` field in `package.json`

The Keycloak JS adapter now uses the https://webpack.js.org/guides/package-exports/[`exports` field] in its `package.json`. This change improves support for more modern bundlers like Webpack 5 and Vite, but comes with some unavoidable breaking changes. Consult the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for more details.

== PKCE enabled by default

The Keycloak JS adapter now sets the `pkceMethod` option to `S256` by default. This enables Proof Key Code Exchange (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636[PKCE]) for all applications using the adapter. If you are using the adapter on a system that doesn't support PKCE, you can set the `pkceMethod` option to `false` to disable it.

= OAuth/OIDC related improvements

== Lightweight access tokens support

This release contains support for Lightweight access tokens. As a result, you can have smaller access tokens for specified clients. These tokens have only a few 
claims, which is why they are smaller. Note that lightweight access token is still JWT signed by the realm key by default and still contains some very basic claims.

This release introduces an *Add to lightweight access token*  flag that is available on some OIDC protocol mappers. Use this flag to specify if a particular claim should be added to a lightweight
access token. It is *OFF* by default, which means that most claims are not added. Also, a client policy executor exists. Use it to specify if a particular client request
should use lightweight access tokens or regular access tokens. A previous release added an *Add to token introspection* switch. You use it to add
claims that are not present in the access token into the introspection endpoint response. Thanks to https://github.com/skabano[Shigeyuki Kabano] for the contribution and Thanks to
https://github.com/tnorimat[Takashi Norimatsu] for a help and review of this feature.

== Scope parameter supported in the refresh token flow

Starting with this release, we support  the`scope` parameter in the OAuth2/OIDC endpoint for token refresh. You can use this parameter to request access tokens with a smaller amount
of scopes than originally granted, which means you cannot increase access token scope. This scope limitation does not affect the scope of the refreshed refresh token. This function works as
described in the OAuth2 specification. Thanks to https://github.com/cgeorgilakis[Konstantinos Georgilakis] for the contribution.

== Client policy executor for enforcing DPoP

A new client policy executor `dpop-bind-enforcer` is introduced. You can use it to enforce DPoP for a particular client if `dpop` preview
 is enabled. Thanks to https://github.com/tnorimat[Takashi Norimatsu] for the contribution.

== Supporting EdDSA

You can create EdDSA realm keys and use them as signature algorithms for various clients. For instance, you can use these keys to sign tokens or for client authentication with signed JWT.
This feature includes identity brokering where {project_name} itself signs client assertions that are used for `private_key_jwt` authentication to third party identity providers. Thanks to
https://github.com/tnorimat[Takashi Norimatsu] and https://github.com/MuhammadZakwan[Muhammad Zakwan Bin Mohd Zahid] for the contribution.

== Option to add X509 thumbprint to JWT when using private_key_jwt authentication for identity providers

OIDC identity providers now have the option *Add X.509 Headers to the JWT* for the case when client authentication with JWT signed by private key is used. This option can be useful
for interoperability with some identity providers such as Azure AD, which require the thumbprint to be present on the JWT. Thanks to https://github.com/MikeTangoEcho[MT] for the contribution.

= Cors improvements

The CORS related Keycloak functionality was extracted into the SPI, which can allow additional flexibility. Note that `CorsSPI` is internal and may change in the
future. Thanks to https://github.com/dteleguin[Dmitry Telegin] for the contribution.

= Truststore Improvements

Keycloak introduces an improved truststores configuration options. The Keycloak truststore is now used across the server: for outgoing connections, mTLS, database drivers and more. It's no longer needed to configure separate truststores for individual areas. To configure the truststore, you can put your truststores files or certificates in the default `conf/truststores`, or use the new `truststore-paths` config option. For details refer to the relevant https://www.keycloak.org/server/keycloak-truststore[guide].

= Versioned Features

Features now support versioning. For preserving backward compatibility all existing features (incl. `account2` and `account3`) are marked as version 1. Newly introduced feature will leverage the versioning allowing users to easily select between different implementations of desired features.

For details refer to the https://www.keycloak.org/server/features[features guide].

== Keycloak CR Truststores

You may also take advantage of the new server-side handling of truststores via the Keycloak CR, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  truststores:
    mystore:
      secret:
        name: mystore-secret
    myotherstore:
      secret:
        name: myotherstore-secret
----

Currently only Secrets are supported.

== Trust Kubernetes CA

The cert for the Kubernetes CA is added automatically to your {project_name} Pods managed by the Operator.

= Automatic certificate management for SAML identity providers

The SAML identity providers can now be configured to automatically download the signing certificates from the IDP entity metadata descriptor endpoint. In order to use the new feature the option `Metadata descriptor URL` should be configured in the provider (URL where the IDP metadata information with the certificates is published) and `Use metadata descriptor URL` needs to be `ON`. The certificates are automatically downloaded and cached in the `public-key-storage` SPI from that URL. The certificates can also be reloaded or imported from the admin console, using the action combo in the provider page.

See the https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#saml-v2-0-identity-providers[documentation] for more details about the new options.

= Non-blocking health check for load balancers

A new health check endpoint available at `/lb-check` was added.
The execution is running in the event loop which means this check is responsive also in overloaded situations when Keycloak needs to handle many requests waiting in request queue.
This behavior is useful, for example, in multi-site deployment where we do not want to fail over to the other site under heavy load.
The endpoint is currently checking availability of the embedded and external Infinispan caches. Other checks may be added later.


This endpoint is not available by default.
To enable it, run Keycloak with feature `multi-site`.
Proceed to https://www.keycloak.org/server/features[Enabling and disabling features] guide for more details.

= Keycloak CR Optimized Field

The Keycloak CR now includes an `startOptimized` field, which may be used to override the default assumption about whether to use the `--optimized` flag for the start command.
As a result, you can use the CR to configure build time options also when a custom Keycloak image is used.

= Enhanced reverse proxy settings

It is now possible to separately enable parsing of either `Forwarded` or `X-Forwarded-*` headers via the new `--proxy-headers` option.
For details, see the https://www.keycloak.org/server/reverseproxy[Reverse Proxy Guide].
The original `--proxy` option is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. For migration instructions, see the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Changes to the user representation in both Admin API and Account contexts

In this release, we are encapsulating the root user attributes (such as `username`, `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `locale`) by moving them to a base/abstract class in order to align how these attributes
are marshalled and unmarshalled when using both Admin and Account REST APIs.

This strategy provides consistency in how attributes are managed by clients and makes sure they conform to the user profile
configuration set to a realm.

For more details, see link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Sequential loading of offline sessions and remote sessions

Starting with this release, the first member of a Keycloak cluster will load remote sessions sequentially instead of in parallel.
If offline session preloading is enabled, those will be loaded sequentially as well.

For more details, see link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Performing actions on behalf of another user is not longer possible when the user is already authenticated

In this release, you can no longer perform actions such as email verification if the user is already authenticated
and the action is bound to another user. For instance, a user can not complete the verification email flow if the email link
is bound to a different account.

= Changes to the email verification flow

In this release, if a user tries to follow the link to verify the email and the email was previously verified, a proper message
will be shown.

In addition to that, a new error (`EMAIL_ALREADY_VERIFIED`) event will be fired to indicate an attempt to verify an already verified email. You can
use this event to track possible attempts to hijack user accounts in case the link has leaked or to alert users if they do not recognize the action.

= Deprecated offline session preloading

The default behavior of Keycloak is to load offline sessions on demand.
The old behavior to preload them at startup is now deprecated, as pre-loading them at startup doesn't scale well with a growing number of sessions, and increases Keycloak memory usage. The old behavior will be removed in a future release.

For more details, check the
link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Configuration option for offline session lifespan override in memory

To reduce memory requirements, we introduced a configuration option to shorten lifespan for offline sessions imported into the Infinispan caches. Currently, the offline session lifespan override is disabled by default.

For more details, check the
link:{adminguide_link}#_offline-access[{adminguide_name}].

= Infinispan metrics use labels for cache manager and cache names

When enabling metrics for {project_name}'s embedded caches, the metrics now use labels for the cache manager and the cache names.

For more details, check the
link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= User attribute value length extension

As of this release, {project_name} supports storing and searching by user attribute values longer than 255 characters, which was previously a limitation.

For more details, check the
link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Authorization Policy

In previous versions of Keycloak when the last member of a User, Group or Client policy was deleted then that policy would also be deleted. Unfortunately this could lead to an escalation of privileges if the policy was used in an aggregate policy. To avoid privilege escalation the effect policies are no longer deleted and an administrator will need to update those policies.

= Keycloak CR cache-config-file option

The Keycloak CR now allows for specifying the `cache-config-file` option via the `cache` spec `configMapFile` field, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.keycloak.org/v2alpha1
kind: Keycloak
metadata:
  name: example-kc
spec:
  ...
  cache:
    configMapFile:
      name: my-configmap
      key: config.xml
----

= Keycloak CR resources options

The Keycloak CR now allows for specifying the `resources` options for managing compute resources for the Keycloak container.
It provides the ability to request and limit resources independently for the main Keycloak deployment via the Keycloak CR, and for the realm import Job via the Realm Import CR.

When no values are specified, the default `requests` memory is set to `1700MiB`, and the `limits` memory is set to `2GiB`.

You can specify your custom values based on your requirements as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.keycloak.org/v2alpha1
kind: Keycloak
metadata:
  name: example-kc
spec:
  ...
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1200m
      memory: 896Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 6
      memory: 3Gi
----

For more details, check the
https://www.keycloak.org/operator/advanced-configuration[Operator Advanced configuration].

= Temporary lockout log replaced with event

There is now a new event `USER_DISABLED_BY_TEMPORARY_LOCKOUT` when a user is temporarily locked out by the brute force protector.
The log with ID `KC-SERVICES0053` has been removed as the new event offers the information in a structured form.

For more details, check the
link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Updates to cookies

Cookie handling code has been refactored and improved, including a new Cookie Provider. This provides better consistency
for cookies handled by Keycloak, and the ability to introduce configuration options around cookies if needed.

= SAML User Attribute Mapper For NameID now suggests only valid NameID formats

User Attribute Mapper For NameID allowed setting `Name ID Format` option to the following values:

- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:X509SubjectName`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:WindowsDomainQualifiedName`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:kerberos`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:entity`

However, Keycloak does not support receiving `AuthnRequest` document with one of these `NameIDPolicy`, therefore these
mappers would never be used. The supported options were updated to only include the following Name ID Formats:

- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient`

= Different JVM memory settings when running in container

Instead of specifying hardcoded values for the initial and maximum heap size, Keycloak uses relative values to the total memory of a container.
The JVM options `-Xms`, and `-Xmx` were replaced by `-XX:InitialRAMPercentage`, and `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage`.

For more details, check the
https://www.keycloak.org/server/containers[Running Keycloak in a container].
