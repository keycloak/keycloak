= Browser tab support for Cordova

We now have support for using browser tab and universal links in the JavaScript adapter for Cordova. This enables SSO
between multiple applications as well as increases security.

Thanks to https://github.com/gtudan[gtudan] for the contribution.


= SAML adapter multitenancy support

The SAML adapter can support multi-tenancy now just like the built-in adapter for OpenID Connect.


= An option to create claims with dots (.) in them
