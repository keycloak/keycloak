// Release notes should contain only headline-worthy new features,
// assuming that people who migrate will read the upgrading guide anyway.

Read on to learn more about each new feature, and https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/upgrading/index.html[find additional details in the upgrading guide] if you are upgrading from a previous release of {project_name}.

= Update Email Workflow is now supported

This feature provides a more secure and consistent flow to update user
emails. Accounts are forced to both re-authenticate and verify their
emails before any account updates.

For more information, see link:{adminguide_link}#_update-email-workflow[Update Email Workflow].

= Passkeys integration is now supported

This feature integrates passkeys seamlessly in the {project_name} forms using both conditional and modal UIs. To activate the integration in the realm, go to *Authentication*, *Policies*, *Webauthn Passwordless Policy* and switch *Enable Passkeys* to enabled.

For more information, see link:{adminguide_link}#passkeys_server_administration_guide[Passkeys].

= New conditional authenticator `Conditional - credential`

The *Conditional - credential* is a new authenticator that checks if a specific credential type has been used (or not used) during the authentication process. This condition is related to the *Passkeys* feature. It is added by {project_name} to the default *browser* flow to skip 2FA in case a passkey was used to log in as the primary credential.

For more information about conditional flows, see link:{adminguide_link}#conditions-in-conditional-flows[Conditions in conditional flows].

= Option to force management interface to use HTTP

A new option, `http-management-scheme`, may be set to `http` to force the management interface to use HTTP rather than inheriting the HTTPS settings of the main interface.

= Option to expose health endpoints on the main HTTP(S) port

With `health-enabled` set to true, you may set the `http-management-health-enabled` to `false` to indicate that health endpoints should be exposed on the main HTTP(s) port instead of the
management port. When this option is `false` you should block unwanted external traffic to `/health` at your proxy.

= Additional context information for log messages (preview)

You can now add context information via the mapped diagnostic context (MDC) to each log message like the realm or the client that initiated the request.
This helps you to track down a warning or error message in the log to a specific caller or environment

For more details on this opt-in feature, see https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging[Configuring logging].

= Ability to specify a `tlsSecret` on the Keycloak CR `ingress` spec

To support basic TLS termination (edge) deployments by the operator, you may now set the Keycloak CR `spec.ingress.tlsSecret` field to a TLS Secret name in the namespace.

= HTTP access logging of incoming HTTP requests

{project_name} supports HTTP access logging to record details of incoming HTTP requests.
While access logs are often used for debugging and traffic analysis, they are also important for security auditing and compliance monitoring.

For more information, see https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging[Configuring logging].

== Possibility to hide identity providers from the Account Console

You can now control which identity providers appear in the Account Console based on different options using
the `Show in Account console` setting. You can choose to show only those linked with a user or hide them completely.

For more information, see link:{adminguide_link}#_general-idp-config[General configuration].

= Email domain for organizations is now optional

In earlier versions, each organization required at least one email domain, which was a limitation for some scenarios.
Starting with this release, an email domain is optional.
ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
Thank you to https://github.com/SferaDev[@SferaDev] for contributing this.
endif::[]

When no domain is specified, organization members will not be validated against domain restrictions during authentication and profile validation.

= Enhancements for single-cluster and multi-cluster setups

This release renamed multi-az to multi-cluster.
The updated documentation describes
how {project_name} clusters can be optionally distributed across multiple availability-zones within a region for increased availability.
The {project_name} Operator now deploys {project_name} across multiple availability zones within a Kubernetes cluster by default. {project_name} also detects split-brains within a cluster.

This change should provide better availability for users who are running {project_name} in Kubernetes clusters that span multiple availability zones.

ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
= Translations managed by Weblate

The {project_name} distribution now includes 35 community translations. With Kazakh, Azerbaijani and Slovenian added in this release.
Community volunteers now maintain some of the translations in https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/keycloak/[Weblate] to keep them up to date.

If you want to volunteer to maintain an existing or a new translation via Weblate, you can find the necessary steps in the https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/main/docs/translation.md[translation guidelines].

= Enforce set up of recovery codes after setting up OTP

If you have enabled OTPs and recovery codes as a second factor for authentication, you can configure the OTP required action to ask users to set up recovery codes once they set up an OTP.

= Supported OAuth standards listed on one page

A new guide exists with a list of https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/specifications[all implemented OpenID Connect related specifications].
