// Release notes should contain only headline-worthy new features,
// assuming that people who migrate will read the upgrading guide anyway.

Read on to learn more about each new feature, and https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/upgrading/index.html[find additional details in the upgrading guide] if you are upgrading from a previous release of {project_name}.

= Update Email Workflow is now supported

This feature provides a more secure and consistent flow to update user
emails. Accounts are forced to both re-authenticate and verify their
emails before any account updates.

For more information, see link:{adminguide_link}#_update-email-workflow[Update Email Workflow].

== OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP) is now supported

DPoP binds an access token and a refresh token together with the public part of a clientâ€™s key pair. This binding prevents an attacker from using stolen tokens. This type of token is a holder-of-key token. Unlike bearer tokens, the recipient of a holder-of-key token can verify if the sender of the token is legitimate.

To enable this feature, start the server with `--features=preview` or `--features=dpop`.

For more information, see link:{adminguide_link}#con-advanced-settings_server_administration_guide[Advanced configuration].

= Passkeys integration is now supported

This feature integrates passkeys seamlessly in the {project_name} forms using both conditional and modal UIs. To activate the integration in the realm, go to *Authentication*, *Policies*, *Webauthn Passwordless Policy* and switch *Enable Passkeys* to enabled.

For more information, see link:{adminguide_link}#passkeys_server_administration_guide[Passkeys].

= New conditional authenticator `Conditional - credential`

The *Conditional - credential* is a new authenticator that checks if a specific credential type has been used (or not used) during the authentication process. This condition is related to the *Passkeys* feature. It is added by {project_name} to the default *browser* flow to skip 2FA in case a passkey was used to log in as the primary credential.

For more information about conditional flows, see link:{adminguide_link}#conditions-in-conditional-flows[Conditions in conditional flows].

= Option to force management interface to use HTTP.

A new option, `http-management-scheme`, may be set to `http` to force the management interface to use HTTP rather than inheriting the HTTPS settings of the main interface.

= Option to expose health endpoints on the main HTTP(S) ports

With `health-enabled` set to true, you may set the `http-management-health-enabled` to `false` to indicate that health endpoints should be exposed on the main HTTP(s) ports instead of the
management port. When this option is `false` you should block unwanted external traffic to `/health` at your proxy.

= Additional context information for log messages (preview)

You can now add context information to each log message like the realm or the client that initiated the request.
This helps you to track down a warning or error message in the log to a specific caller or environment

For more details on this opt-in feature, see the https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging[Logging guide].

= Ability to specify a `tlsSecret` on the Keycloak CR `ingress` spec

To support basic TLS termination (edge) deployments by the operator, you may now set the Keycloak CR `spec.ingress.tlsSecret` field to a TLS Secret name in the namespace.

= HTTP access logging of incoming HTTP requests

{project_name} supports HTTP access logging to record details of incoming HTTP requests.
While access logs are often used for debugging and traffic analysis, they are also important for security auditing and compliance monitoring.

For more information, see https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging[Configuring logging].

== Possibility to hide identity providers from the Account Console

You can now control which identity providers appear in the Account Console based on different options using
the `Show in Account console` setting. You can choose to show only those linked with a user or hide them completely.

For more information, see link:{adminguide_link}#_general-idp-config[General configuration].

= Email domain for organizations is now optional

In earlier versions, each organization required at least one email domain, which was a limitation for some scenarios.
Starting with this release, an email domain is optional.

Thank you to https://github.com/SferaDev[@SferaDev] for contributing this.

When no domain is specified, organization members will not be validated against domain restrictions during authentication and profile validation.

= Enhancements for single-cluster and multi-cluster setups

This release renamed multi-az to multi-cluster.
ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
The updated documentation includes a separate guide for single-cluster setups, which describes

ifeval::[{project_product}==true]
The updated documentation describes 
endif::[]
how {project_name} clusters can be optionally "stretched" across multiple availability-zones for increased availability.
The {project_name} Operator now deploys {project_name} across multiple availability zones within a Kubernetes cluster by default. {project_name} also detects split-brains within a cluster.

This change should provide better availability for users who are running {project_name} in Kubernetes clusters that span multiple availability zones.

ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
= Translations managed by Weblate

The {project_name} distribution now includes 35 community translations. With Kazakh, Azerbaijani and Slovenian added in this release.
Community volunteers now maintain some of the translations in https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/keycloak/[Weblate] to keep them up to date.

If you want to volunteer to maintain an existing or a new translation via Weblate, you can find the necessary steps in the https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/main/docs/translation.md[translation guidelines].

= Setting up OTP can enfore set up of recovery codes

If you have enabled OTPs and recovery codes as a second factor for authentication, you can configure the OTP required action to ask users to set up recovery codes once they set up an OTP.

Thank you to https://github.com/dasniko[@dasniko] for contributing this.

= MDC logging to correlate messages with realms and clients

As a new preview feature, you can include in all log messages in the mapped diagnostic context (MDC) of each message realm name, client ID and other information.
This helps you to correlate error messages to a specific realm or client.
ifeval::[{project_community}==true]

A new guide exist with a list of https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/specifications[all implemented OpenID Connect related specifications].
