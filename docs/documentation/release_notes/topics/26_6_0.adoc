= Sensitive Keycloak information is not displayed in the HTTP Access log

If you are using the HTTP Access logging capability, sensitive information is omitted.
It means that tokens in the 'Authorization' HTTP header and specific sensitive Keycloak cookies are not shown.

For more information, see https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging#http-access-logging[Configuring HTTP access logging].

= HTTP access logs in a dedicated file

HTTP access logs can now be written to a dedicated file, separate from the server logs.
This makes it easier to process and archive access logs independently for security auditing and compliance monitoring.

For more information, see https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging#http-access-logging[Configuring HTTP access logging].
