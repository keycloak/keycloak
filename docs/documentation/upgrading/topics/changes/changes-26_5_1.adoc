Notable changes may include internal behavior changes that prevent common misconfigurations, bugs that are fixed, or changes to simplify running {project_name}.
It also lists significant changes to internal APIs.

=== New database indexes on the `BROKER_LINK` table

The `BROKER_LINK` table now contains two additional indexes `IDX_BROKER_LINK_USER_ID` and `IDX_BROKER_LINK_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` to improve performance.

If the table contains more than 300000 entries, {project_name} will skip the index creation by default during the automatic schema migration and instead log the SQL statement on the console during migration to be applied manually after {project_name}'s startup.
See the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for details on how to configure a different limit.
