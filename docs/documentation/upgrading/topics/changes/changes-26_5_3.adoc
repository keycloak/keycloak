== Notable changes

Notable changes may include internal behavior changes that prevent common misconfigurations, bugs that are fixed, or changes to simplify running {project_name}.
It also lists significant changes to internal APIs.

=== More changes for the `server-info` system information

In version 26.4.0, the `server-info` endpoint changed to just return the system information for administrators in the admin realm. Nevertheless, the version property was detected to be needed by some products that interact with {project_name}. Now that property is included for administrators in the realm with permission `manage-realm`.

The workaround of the `view-system` permission is more restricted too. It can only be assigned by administrators in the master realm using link:{adminguide_link}#_fine_grained_permissions[FGAP]. This permission will be deleted in a future version.
