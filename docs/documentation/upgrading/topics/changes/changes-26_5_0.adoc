== Breaking changes

=== Method `UserProfile#toRepresentation(boolean)` added

The `UserProfile` interface has a new method `toRepresentation(boolean)`. This method allows clients to specify whether to include
only the basic attributes in representations or all of them.

The `UserProfile` interface is a private API and should not be implemented by custom code. However, if you have extensions that
implement this interface, you will need to update your code to accommodate this new method.

Breaking changes are identified as those that might require changes for existing users to their configurations or applications.
In minor or patch releases, {project_name} will only introduce breaking changes to fix bugs.

=== Corrected encoding when sending OpenID Connect client secrets when acting as a broker

In a scenario where {project_name} acts as a broker and connects via OpenID Connect to another identity provider, it now sends the client credentials via basic authentication in the correct encoding as specified in RFC6749.
You are not affected if you configured {project_name} to send the credentials in the request body.

This prevents problems with client IDs or passwords that contain, for example, a colon or a percentage sign.

To revert to the old behavior, change the client authentication to the deprecated option *Client secret sent as HTTP Basic authentication without URL encoding* (`client_secret_basic_unencoded`).

=== Identity Provider refactoring

The private SPI for identity providers have been refactored. This is to allow identity providers to support more use
-cases than federated user authentication.

For anyone implementing a custom federated user authentication identity provider and are not extending one provided
by Keycloak or `AbstractIdentityProvider` you need to update your implementation to implement
the new `UserAuthenticationIdentityProvider` interface (all methods remain the same, they have just been moved).


// ------------------------ Notable changes ------------------------ //
== Notable changes

Notable changes may include internal behavior changes that prevent common misconfigurations, bugs that are fixed, or changes to simplify running {project_name}.

=== `log-console-color` will automatically enable if supported by the terminal

The `log-console-color` previously defaulted to `false`, but it will now instead check if the terminal supports color.

You may still explicitly disable color support by setting the option to `false`.

=== User sessions created with "Remember Me" are no longer valid if "Remember Me" is disabled for the realm

When the "Remember Me" option is disabled in the realm settings, all user sessions previously created with the "Remember Me" flag are now considered invalid.
Users will be required to log in again, and any associated refresh tokens will no longer be usable.
User sessions created without selecting "Remember Me" are not affected.

=== Correct encoding for OpenID Connect client credentials when acting as a broker

In a scenario where {project_name} acts as a broker and connects via OpenID Connect to another identity provider, it now sends the client credentials via basic authentication in the correct encoding as specified in RFC6749.

This prevents problems with client IDs or passwords that contain, for example, a colon or a percentage sign.

To revert to the old behavior, change the client authentication to *Client secret sent as HTTP Basic authentication without URL encoding (deprecated)* (`client_secret_basic_unencoded`).

=== Allowing realm administrators granted with the `realm-admin` role to assign admin roles

In previous versions, realm administrators granted with the `realm-admin` role were not able to grant admin roles for delegated realm administrators.
This was only possible by granting the `admin` role to a master realm user, making this user a server admin.

In this release, realm administrators with the `realm-admin` role can assign admin roles to users in their realm, allowing them to delegate administrative tasks without needing server admin privileges.

If you are using FGAP to delegate administration to users in a realm other than the master realm,
make sure the users granted with the `realm-admin` role are expected to have this role to avoid privilege scalation.

The documentation is also updated with additional information about the different types of realm administrators.
For more information, see link:{adminguide_link}#_fine_grained_permissions[Delegating realm administration using permissions].

// ------------------------ Deprecated features ------------------------ //
== Deprecated features

The following sections provide details on deprecated features.

=== Sending OpenID Connect client secret via basic authentication without URL encoding

In a scenario where {project_name} acts as a broker and connects via OpenID Connect to another identity provider, you can choose to send the client secret as *Client secret sent as HTTP Basic authentication without URL encoding* (`client_secret_basic_unencoded`). While this violates RFC6749, it can be used to keep the default behavior of earlier versions of {project_name}.

This behavior is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Keycloak.
