== Notable changes

Notable changes may include internal behavior changes that prevent common misconfigurations, bugs that are fixed, or changes to simplify running {project_name}.

=== `log-console-color` will automatically enable if supported by the terminal

The `log-console-color` previously defaulted to `false`, but it will now instead check if the terminal supports color.

You may still explicitly disable color support by setting the option to `false`.

=== User sessions created with "Remember Me" are no longer valid if "Remember Me" is disabled for the realm

When the "Remember Me" option is disabled in the realm settings, all user sessions previously created with the "Remember Me" flag are now considered invalid.
Users will be required to log in again, and any associated refresh tokens will no longer be usable.
User sessions created without selecting "Remember Me" are not affected.

=== Correct encoding for OpenID Connect client credentials when acting as a broker

In a scenario where {project_name} acts as a broker and connects via OpenID Connect to another identity provider, it now sends the client credentials via basic authentication in the correct encoding as specified in RFC6749.

This prevents problems with client IDs or passwords that contain, for example, a colon or a percentage sign.

To revert to the old behavior, change the client authentication to *Client secret sent as HTTP Basic authentication without URL encoding (deprecated)* (`client_secret_basic_unencoded`).
