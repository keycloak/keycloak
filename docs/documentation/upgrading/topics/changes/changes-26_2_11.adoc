=== User sessions created with "Remember Me" are no longer valid if "Remember Me" is disabled for the realm

When the "Remember Me" option is disabled in the realm settings, all user sessions previously created with the "Remember Me" flag are now considered invalid.
Users will be required to log in again, and any associated refresh tokens will no longer be usable.
User sessions created without selecting "Remember Me" are not affected.
