== Upgrading {project_name}

This {section} describes how to upgrade {project_name}. Use the following procedures in this order:

. Review the migration changes from the previous version of {project_name}.
. Upgrade the {project_name} server.
. Upgrade the {project_name} adapters.
. Upgrade the {project_name} Client Libraries (Admin client, Authorization client, Policy enforcer). These are released independently of the {project_name} server
and could be typically updated independently of the {project_name} server as the last released version of the client libraries should be compatible with the last released version of
the {project_name} server. For more information, see the link:{upgradingclientlibs_link}[{upgradingclientlibs_name}].
