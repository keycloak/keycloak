= Creating resources

Creating a resource is straightforward and generic. Your main concern is the granularity of the resources you create. In other words, resources can
be created to represent a set of one or more resources and the way you define them is crucial to managing permissions.

To create a new resource, click *Create resource*.

In {project_name}, a resource defines a small set of information that is common to different types of resources, such as:

* *Name*
+
A human-readable and unique string describing this resource.

[[_resource_create_type]]
* *Type*
+
A string uniquely identifying the type of a set of one or more resources. The type is a _string_ used to group different resource instances.
For example, the default type for the default resource that is automatically created is `urn:resource-server-name:resources:default`

[[_resource_create_uri]]
* *URIS*
+
URIS that provides the locations/addresses for the resource. For HTTP resources, the URIS
are usually the relative paths used to serve these resources.
+
* *Scopes*
+
One or more scopes to associate with the resource.

== Resource attributes

Resources may have attributes associated with them. These attributes can be used to provide additional information about
a resource and to provide additional information to policies when evaluating permissions associated with a resource.

Each attribute is a key and value pair where the value can be a set of one or many strings. Multiple values can be defined for an attribute by separating each value with a comma.


== Typed resources

The type field of a resource can be used to group different resources together, so they can be protected using a common set of permissions.

== Resource owners

Resources also have an owner. By default, resources are owned by the resource server.

However, resources can also be associated with users, so you can create permissions based on the resource owner. For example, only the resource owner is allowed to delete or update a given resource.

== Managing resources remotely

Resource management is also exposed through the <<_service_protection_api, Protection API>> to allow resource servers to remotely manage their resources.

When using the Protection API, resource servers can be implemented to manage resources owned by their users. In this case, you can
specify the user identifier to configure a resource as belonging to a specific user.

[NOTE]
{project_name} provides resource servers complete control over their resources. In the future, we should be able to
allow users to control their own resources as well as approve authorization requests and manage permissions, especially when using the UMA protocol.
