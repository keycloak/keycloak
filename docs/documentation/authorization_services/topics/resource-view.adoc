[[_resource_view]]
= Viewing resources

On the *Resource* page, you see a list of the resources associated with a resource server.

.Resources
image:images/resource/view.png[alt="Resources"]

The resource list provides information about the protected resources, such as:

* Type
* Owner
* URIs
* Associated scopes, if any
* Associated permissions

From this list, you can also directly create a permission by clicking *Create Permission* for the resource for which you want to create the permission.

[NOTE]
Before creating permissions for your resources, be sure you have already defined the policies that you want to associate with the permission.
