= Managing resource servers

According to the OAuth2 specification, a resource server is a server hosting the protected resources and capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests.

In {project_name}, resource servers are provided with a rich platform for enabling fine-grained authorization for their protected resources, where authorization decisions can be made based on different access control mechanisms.

Any client application can be configured to support fine-grained permissions. In doing so, you are conceptually turning the client application into a resource server.
