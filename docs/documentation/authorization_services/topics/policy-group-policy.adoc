== Configuration

* *Name*
+
A human-readable and unique string describing the policy. A best practice is to use names that are closely related to your business and security requirements, so you
can identify them more easily.
+
* *Description*
+
A string containing details about this policy.
+
* *Groups Claim*
+
Specifies the name of the claim in the token holding the group names and/or paths. Usually, authorization requests are processed based on an ID Token or Access Token
previously issued to a client acting on behalf of some user. If defined, the token must include a claim from where this policy is going to obtain the groups
the user is a member of. If not defined, user's groups are obtained from your realm configuration.
+
* *Groups*
+
Allows you to select the groups that should be enforced by this policy when evaluating permissions. After adding a group, you can extend access to children of the group
by marking the checkbox *Extend to Children*. If left unmarked, access restrictions only apply to the selected group.
+
* *Logic*
+
The logic of this policy to apply after the other conditions have been evaluated.
