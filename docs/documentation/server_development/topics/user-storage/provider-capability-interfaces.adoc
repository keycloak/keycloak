[[_provider_capability_interfaces]]

=== Provider capability interfaces

If you have examined the `UserStorageProvider` interface closely you might notice that it does not define any methods for locating or managing users. These methods are actually defined in other _capability interfaces_ depending on what scope of capabilities your external user store can provide and execute on. For example, some external stores are read-only and can only do simple queries and credential validation. You will only be required to implement the _capability interfaces_ for the features you are able to. You can implement these interfaces:


|===
|SPI|Description

|`org.keycloak.storage.user.UserLookupProvider`|This interface is required if you want to be able to log in with users from this external store. Most (all?) providers implement this interface.
|`org.keycloak.storage.user.UserQueryMethodsProvider`|Defines complex queries that are used to locate one or more users. You must implement this interface if you want to view and manage users from the administration console.
|`org.keycloak.storage.user.UserCountMethodsProvider`|Implement this interface if your provider supports count queries.
|`org.keycloak.storage.user.UserQueryProvider`|This interface is combined capability of `UserQueryMethodsProvider` and `UserCountMethodsProvider`.
|`org.keycloak.storage.user.UserRegistrationProvider`|Implement this interface if your provider supports adding and removing users.
|`org.keycloak.storage.user.UserBulkUpdateProvider`|Implement this interface if your provider supports bulk update of a set of users.
|`org.keycloak.credential.CredentialInputValidator`|Implement this interface if your provider can validate one or more different credential types (for example, if your provider can validate a password).
|`org.keycloak.credential.CredentialInputUpdater`|Implement this interface if your provider supports updating one or more different credential types.
