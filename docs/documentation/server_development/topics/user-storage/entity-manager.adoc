=== Accessing the new entity manager

In order to simply access your data in your {project_name} extension, you can obtain the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.2/apidocs/jakarta.persistence/jakarta/persistence/entitymanager[EntityManager] for the additional datasources used in these quickstarts.
It helps you to interact with entities specified for your datasource, as it provides some kind of bridge between your JPA entities and the database.

You can use the new entity manager (for the `user-store` datasource) as follows:

[source,java]
----
EntityManager em = session.getProvider(JpaConnectionProvider.class, "user-store").getEntityManager();
var user = em.find(org.your.extension.UserEntity.class, 123L);
----
