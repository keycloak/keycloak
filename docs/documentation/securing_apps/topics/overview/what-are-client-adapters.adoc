=== Client adapters

{project_name} client adapters are libraries that make it very easy to secure applications and services with {project_name}. We call them
adapters rather than libraries as they provide a tight integration to the underlying platform and framework. This makes our adapters easy to use and they
require less boilerplate code than what is typically required by a library.
