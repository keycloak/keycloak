2026-01-12 14:13:36,500 traceId=, parentId=, spanId=, sampled= ERROR [org.keycloak.quarkus.runtime.cli.ExecutionExceptionHandler] (main) ERROR: Incorrect state of migration. You are trying to run nightly server version '999.0.0' against a database, which was previously migrated to version '26.4.7'. This indicates that you are trying to run development server version against production database, which can result in a loss or corruption of data, and also does not allow upgrading. If it is intended, use the option spi-datastore-legacy-allow-migrate-existing-database-to-snapshot of the datastore provider when starting the server and explicitly set it to true.
