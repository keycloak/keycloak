== User Session Management

When a user logs into a realm, {project_name} maintains a user session for them and remembers each and every client they
have visited within the session.  There are a lot of administrative
functions that realm admins can perform on these user sessions.  They can view login stats for the entire realm and dive down
into each client to see who is logged in and where.  Admins can logout a user or set of users from the Admin Console. They
can revoke tokens and set up all the token and session timeouts there too.
