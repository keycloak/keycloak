The {project_name} can pre-generate configuration files that you can use to install a client adapter for in your application's
deployment environment.  A number of adapter types are supported for both OIDC and SAML.  Go to the `Installation` tab of the
client you want to generate configuration for.

are supported.  The mod-auth-mellon Apache HTTPD adapter for SAML is supported as well as standard SAML entity descriptor files.
