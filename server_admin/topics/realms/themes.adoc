=== Themes and Internationalization

Themes allow you to change the look and feel of any UI in {project_name}.  Themes are configured per realm.  To change
a theme go to the `Realm Settings` left menu item and click on the `Themes` tab.

The link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] goes into how to create a new themes or modify existing ones.

==== Internationalization

Every UI screen is internationalized in {project_name}.  The default language is English, but if you turn on the
`Internationalization` switch on the `Theme` tab you can choose which locales you want to support and what the default locale
will be.  The next time a user logs in, they will be able to choose a language on the login page to use for the login screens,
User Account Management UI, and Admin Console.  The link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] explains
how you can offer additional languages.


[[_user_locale_selection]]
===== User Locale selection

In order to select the best possible locale for a user there is a locale selector provider that handles deciding what
is the best locale on the information available. One thing to note here is that it is not always known who the user is.
For this reason the previously authenticated users locale is remembered in a persisted cookie.

The logic for selecting the locale uses the first of the following that is available:

* User selected - when the user has selected a locale using the drop-down locale selector
* User profile - when there is an authenticated user and the user has a preferred locale set
* Client selected - passed by the client using for example ui_locales parameter
* Cookie - last locale selected on the browser
* Accepted language - locale from `Accept-Language` header
* Realm default
* If none of the above, fallback to English

When a user is authenticated an action is triggered to update the locale in the persisted cookie mentioned earlier. If the
user has actively switched the locale through the locale selector on the login pages the users locale is also updated at
this point.
