==== Twitter

There are a number of steps you have to complete to be able to enable login with Twitter.  First, go to the `Identity Providers` left menu item
and select `Twitter` from the `Add provider` drop down list.  This will bring you to the `Add identity provider` page.

You can't click save yet, as you'll need to obtain a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from Twitter.  One piece of data you'll need from this
page is the `Redirect URI`.  You'll have to provide that to Twitter when you register {project_name} as a client there, so
copy this URI to your clipboard.

To enable login with Twtter you first have to create an application in the https://developer.twitter.com/apps/[Twitter Application Management].

Enter in a Name and Description.  The Website can be anything, but cannot have a `localhost` address.  For the
`Callback URL` you must copy the `Redirect URI` from the {project_name} `Add Identity Provider` page.

WARNING: You cannot use `localhost` in the `Callback URL`.  Instead replace it with `127.0.0.1` if you are trying to test drive Twitter login on your laptop.

After clicking save you will be brought to the `Details` page.

Finally, you will need to obtain the API Key and secret from this page and copy them back into the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields on the {project_name} `Add identity provider` page.
