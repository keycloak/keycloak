==== Instagram

There are a number of steps you have to complete to be able to enable login with Instagram.  First, go to the `Identity Providers` left menu item
and select `Instagram` from the `Add provider` drop down list.  This will bring you to the `Add identity provider` page.

You can't click save yet, as you'll need to obtain a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from Instagram.  One piece of data you'll need from this
page is the `Redirect URI`.  You'll have to provide that to Instagram when you register {project_name} as a client there, so
copy this URI to your clipboard.

To enable login with Instagram you first have to create a project and a client. Instagram API is managed through the https://developers.facebook.com/[Facebook Developer Console].

NOTE: Facebook often changes the look and feel of the Facebook Developer Console, so these directions might not always be up to date and the
      configuration steps might be slightly different.

Once you've logged into the console there is a menu in the top right corner of the screen that says `My Apps`.  Select the `Add a New App`
menu item.

Fill all required fields. Once you're done with that, you will be brought to the dashboard
for the application. In the menu in the left navigation panel select `Basic` under `Settings`.

.Add Platform

.Add a Product

Select `Dashboard` from the left menu and click `Set Up` in the Instagram box. In the left menu then select `Basic Display` under `Instagram`
and click `Create New App`.

.Create a New Instagram App ID

Specify `Display Name`.

.Setup the App

Copy and paste the `Redirect URI` from the {project_name} `Add identity provider` page into the `Valid OAuth Redirect URIs` of the Instagram `Client OAuth Settings` settings block.

You can use this URL also for `Deauthorize Callback URL` and `Data Deletion Request URL`. {project_name} currently doesn't support either of them,
but the Facebook Developer Console requires both of them to be filled.

You will need also to obtain the App ID and App Secret from this page so you can enter them into the {project_name} `Add identity provider` page.
To obtain this click on `Show` under `App Secret`. Go back to {project_name} and specify those items and finally save your Instagram Identity Provider.

Now you can make the Instagram app public. Click `App Review` left menu item and then `Requests`. After that follow the instructions on screen.
