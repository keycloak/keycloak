==== PayPal

There are a number of steps you have to complete to be able to login to PayPal.  First, go to the `Identity Providers` left menu item
and select `PayPal` from the `Add provider` drop down list.  This will bring you to the `Add identity provider` page.

You can't click save yet, as you'll need to obtain a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from PayPal.  One piece of data you'll need from this
page is the `Redirect URI`.  You'll have to provide that to PayPal when you register {project_name} as a client there, so
copy this URI to your clipboard.

To enable login with PayPal you first have to register an application project in
https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications[PayPal Developer applications].

.Add a New App

.Register App

You will now be brought to the app settings page.

.Do the following changes

- Choose to configure either Sandbox or Live (choose Live if you haven't enabled the `Target Sandbox` switch on the `Add identity provider` page)
- Copy Client ID and Secret so you can paste them into the {project_name} `Add identity provider` page.
- Scroll down to `App Settings`
- Copy the `Redirect URI` from the {project_name} `Add Identity Provider` page and enter it into the `Return URL` field.
- Check the `Log In with PayPal` checkbox.
- Check the `Full name` checkbox under the personal information section.
- Check the `Email address` checkbox under the address information section.
- Add both a privacy and a user agreement URL pointing to the respective pages on your domain.
