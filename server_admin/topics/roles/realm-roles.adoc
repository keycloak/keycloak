=== Realm Roles

Realm-level roles are a global namespace to define your roles. You can see the list of built-in and created roles by clicking the `Roles` left menu item.

To create a role, click *Add Role* on this page, enter in the name and description of the role, and click *Save*.

.Add Role

The value for the `description` field is localizable by specifying a substitution variable with `$\{var-name}` strings. The localized value is then configured within property files in your theme. See the link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information on localization. If a client requires user _consent_, this description string is displayed on the consent page for the user.

If the client has to explicitly request for a realm role, set `Scope Param Required` to true. The role then has to be specified using the `scope` parameter when requesting a token. Multiple realm roles are separated by space:

`scope=admin user`
