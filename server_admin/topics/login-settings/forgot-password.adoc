== Enabling Forgot Password

If you enable `Forgot Password`, users can reset their login credentials if they forget their passwords or lose their OTP generator. 

.Procedure
. Click *Realm Settings* in the menu.
. Click the *Login* tab.

. Click this link to bring users where they can enter their username or email address and receive an email with a link to reset their credentials.

The text sent in the email is configurable. See link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information.

When users click the email link, {project_name} asks them to update their password, and if they have set up an OTP generator, {project_name} asks them to reconfigure the OTP generator.  Depending on security requirements of your organization, you may not want users to reset their OTP generator through email. 

To change this behavior, perform these steps:

.Procedure
. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *Flows* tab.
. Select the *Reset Credentials* flow.

If you do not want to reset the OTP, set the `Reset OTP` requirement to *Disabled*.
. Click the *Required Actions* tab. Ensure _Update Password_ is enabled.
