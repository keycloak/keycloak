== Groups

Groups in {project_name} allow you to manage a common set of attributes and role mappings for a set of users.
Users can be members of zero or more groups.
Users inherit the attributes and role mappings assigned to each group.  To manage groups go to the `Groups` left menu
item.

Groups are hierarchical.
A group can have many subgroups, but a group can only have one parent.
Subgroups inherit the attributes and role mappings from the parent.
This applies to the user as well.
So, if you have a parent group and a child group and a user that only belongs to the child group, the user inherits the attributes and role mappings of both the parent and child.
In this example, we have a top level `Sales` group and a child `North America` subgroup.  To add a group, click on the
parent you want to add a new child to and click `New` button.  Select the `Groups` icon in the tree to make a top-level group.
Entering in a group name in the `Create Group` screen and hitting `Save` will bring you to the individual group management page.

The `Attributes` and `Role Mappings` tab work exactly as the tabs with similar names under a user.  Any attributes and role mappings
you define will be inherited by the groups and users that are members of this group.

To add a user to a group you need to go all the way back to the user detail page and click on the `Groups` tab there.

Select a group from the `Available Groups` tree and hit the `join` button to add the user to a group.  Vice versa to remove a group.
Here we've added the user _Jim_ to the _North America_ sales group.  If you go back to the detail page for that group and
select the `Membership` tab, _Jim_ is now displayed there.
