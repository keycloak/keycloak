[role="_abstract"]
{project_name} includes a suite of auditing capabilities. You can record every login and administrator action and review those actions in the Admin Console. {project_name} also includes a Listener SPI that listens for events and can trigger actions. Examples of built-in listeners include log files and sending emails if an event occurs.
