        There are multiple ways you can logout from a web application.  For Java EE servlet containers, you can call
        HttpServletRequest.logout().
        For any other browser application, you can point the browser at any url of your web application that has
        a security constraing and pass in a query parameter GLO, i.e. <literal>http://myapp?GLO=true</literal>.
        This will log you out if you have an SSO session with your browser.
