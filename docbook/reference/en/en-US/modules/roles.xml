    <para>
        In Keycloak, roles (or permissions) can be defined globally at the realm level, or individually per application.
        Each role has a name which must be unique at the level it is defined in, i.e. you can have only one "admin" role at
        the realm level.  You may have that a role named "admin" within an Application too, but "admin" must be unique
        for that application.
    </para>

        The description of a role is displayed in the OAuth Grant page when Keycloak is processing a browser OAuth
        Grant request.  Look for more features being added here in the future like internationalization and other fine
        grain options.

        <title>Composite Roles</title>
        <para>
            Any realm or application level role can be turned into a Composite Role.  A Composite Role is a role that has
            one or more additional roles associated with it.  I guess another term for it could be Role Group.
            When a composite role is mapped to the user, the user gains the permission of that role, plus any other role the
            composite is associated with.  This association is dynamic.  So, if you add  or remove an associated role from
            the composite, then all users that are mapped to the composite role will automatically have those permissions
            added or removed.  Composites can also be used to define Application or OAuth Client scopes.
        </para>
        <para>
            Composite roles can be associated with any type of role Realm or Application.  In the admin console simple
            flip the composite switch in the Role detail, and you will get a screen that will allow you to associate roles
            with the composite.
