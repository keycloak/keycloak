    <title>OIDC Token and SAML Assertion Mappings</title>
    <para>
        Applications that receive ID Tokens, Access Tokens, or SAML assertions may need or want different user metadata
        and roles.  Keycloak allows you to define what exactly is transferred.  You can hardcode roles, claims and custom
        attributes.  You can pull user metadata into a token or assertion.  You can rename roles.  Basicall you have
        a lot of control of what exactly goes back to the client.

        Within the admin console, if you go to an application you've registered, you'll see a "Mappers" sub-menu item.
        This is the place where you can control how a OIDC ID Token, Access Token, and SAML login response assertions look
        like.  When you click on this you'll see some default mappers that have been set up for you.  Clicking the
        "Add Builtin" button gives you the option to add other preconfigured mappers.  Clicking on "Create" allows
        you to define your own protocol mappers.  The tooltips are very helpful to learn exactly what you can do
        to tailor your tokens and assertions.  They should be enough to guide you through the process.
