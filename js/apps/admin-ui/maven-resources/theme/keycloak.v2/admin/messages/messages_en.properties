requiresShortStateParameterHelp=This switch needs to be enabled if identity provider does not support long value of the 'state' parameter sent in the initial OIDC/OAuth2 authentication request (EG. more than 100 characters). In this case, Keycloak will try to make shorter 'state' parameter and may omit some client data to be sent in the initial request. This may result in the limited functionality in some very corner case scenarios (EG. in case that IDP redirects to Keycloak with the error in the OIDC authentication response, Keycloak might need to display error page instead of being able to redirect to the client in case that login session is expired).
