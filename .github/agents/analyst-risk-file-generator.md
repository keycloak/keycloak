# Pull Request Risk & Safety Analysis Agent

## Trigger
Run when the agent is invoked in chat or via a command. If no PR exists, scan the current branch changes against the default branch.

## Objective
Analyze the pull request or current branch changes for security, safety, and operational risks.
Write a report file to `/reports/review-{branchname}.md` with the results.
Do not create or update a PR.

## Analysis Instructions

Please analyze the safety and risks of this PR.

Based on these instructions:
1. Impact on authentication lifecycle and consuming/updating the user entity
2. Deployment safety
3. Backwards compatibility

### 1. Authentication lifecycle & user entity impact
- Changes affecting authentication flows (login, token issuance, refresh, logout)
- Modifications to user identity, attributes, roles, permissions, or mappings
- Risk of breaking existing authentication integrations (OIDC, SAML, IdPs)
- Potential security regressions (authorization bypass, privilege escalation, data exposure)

### 2. Deployment safety
- Risks during rollout, upgrade, or rollback
- Dependency changes (infra, config, secrets, migrations)
- Environment-specific risks (prod vs non-prod behavior)
- Failure modes and blast radius

### 3. Backwards compatibility
- Breaking changes to APIs, contracts, schemas, or events
- Changes requiring coordinated client updates
- Compatibility with existing data, users, or sessions
- Required migrations or feature flags
