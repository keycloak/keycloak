=== Admin Events

Any action an admin performs within the admin console can be recorded for auditing purposes.
The Admin Console performs administrative functions by invoking on the {{book.project.name}} REST interface.  {{book.project.name}}
audits the admin APIs be storing these REST invocations.  These REST invocations can then be viewed in the Admin Console.

To enable auditing of Admin actions, go to the `Events` left menu item and select the `Config` tab.

In the `Admin Events Settings` section, turn on the `Save Events` switch.

The `Include Representation` switch will include any JSON document that is sent to the admin REST API when they are being
invoked upon.  This allows you to view exactly what an admin has done, but can lead to a lot of information stored in the
database.  The `Clear admin events` button allows you to wipe out the current information stored.

To view the admin events go to the `Admin Events` tab.

If the `Details` column has a `Representation` box, you can click on that to view the JSON that was sent with that operation.
