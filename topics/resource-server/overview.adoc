== Managing Resource Servers

If you are familiar with OAuth2, a Resource Server is the server hosting the protected resources and capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests.

In {{book.project.name}}, resource servers are provided with a rich platform for enabling fine-grained authorization to their protected resources, where authorization decisions can be made
based on different access control mechanisms.

Any client application can be configured to support fine-grained permissions. When you do that, you are conceptually turning the client application into a resource server.
