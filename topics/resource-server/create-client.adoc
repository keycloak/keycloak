In this page, fill in the fields as follows:

* Enter in the `Client ID` of the client. For insance, _my-resource-server_.
* Enter in the `Root URL` for your application. For instance:
+
```bash
http://${host}:${port}/my-resource-server
```

Finally, click `Save`. This will create the client and bring you to the client `Settings` tab.
