== Exporting and Importing Configuration

The configuration settings for a resource server can be exported and downloaded. The resulting configuration contains settings you've introduced for the resource server (client).
Import/Export is helpful when you would like to create an initial configuration for a resource server or to update an existing configuration. The configuration contains definitions for:

* Protected Resources and Scopes
* Policies
* Permissions

To export configuration, go to the `Resource Server Settings` page.

.Resource Server Settings

In this page, you'll see a `Export Settings` section, which provides a single `Export` button. Click on that button and you'll see.

The configuration is exported in JSON format and displyed in a text area, which you can copy and paste. You may also click the `Download` button to download the configuration as a file.

=== Importing

To import a file with the configuration for a resource server, click on the `Select file` to open a file chooser dialog to select a file in your
filesystem containing the configuration you want to import.
