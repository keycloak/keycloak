=== LDAP Mapper

For the more advanced usecases, you have the possibility to create your own implementation of LDAP mapper or just subclass from some already existing mapper
implementation. You will need to implement `UserFederationMapperFactory` interface.

In most cases, instead of creating `UserFederationMapperFactory` from scratch, you can create subclasses of `AbstractLDAPFederationMapperFactory`, which itself
implements `UserFederationMapperFactory`.

Then you need to create mapper implementation, which will be subclass of `AbstractLDAPFederationMapper` (this mapper implementation will be returned by
`YourAbstractLDAPFederationMapperFactorySubclass.createMapper` method).

For details on how to package and deploy a custom provider refer to the <<providers.adoc#providers,Service Provider Interfaces>> chapter.
