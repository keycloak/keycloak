=== Available User Session Data

After a user logs in from the external IDP, there's some additional user session note data that Keycloak stores that you can access.
This data can be propagated to the client requesting a login via the token or SAML assertion being passed back to it by using an appropriate client mapper.

BROKER_PROVIDER_ID::
  This is the IDP alias of the broker used to perform the login.

You can use a <<fake/../../clients/protocol-mappers.adoc#_protocol-mappers, Protocol Mapper>> to propagate this information to your clients.
