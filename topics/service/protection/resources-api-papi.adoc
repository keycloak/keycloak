== Managing Resources Using the Protection API

Resource servers can manage their resources remotely using a UMA-compliant endpoint.

```bash
http://${host}:${port}/auth/realms/${realm_name}/authz/protection/resource_set
```

This endpoint provides some registration operations as follows:

* Create resource set description: POST /resource_set
* Read resource set description: GET /resource_set/{_id}
* Update resource set description: PUT /resource_set/{_id}
* Delete resource set description: DELETE /resource_set/{_id}
* List resource set descriptions: GET /resource_set
* List resource set descriptions using a filter: GET /resource_set?filter=${filter}

For more details about the contract for each of these operations, please take a look at https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/rec-oauth-resource-reg-v1_0_1.html[UMA Resource Set Registration].
