==== Internationalization

Every UI screen is internationalized in {{book.project.name}}.  The default language is english, but if you turn on the
`Internationalization` switch on the `Theme` tab you can choose which locales you want to support and what the default locale
will be.  The next time a user logs in, they will be able to choose a language on the login page to use for the login screens,
User Account Management UI, and Admin Console.  The link:{{book.developerguide.link}}[{{book.developerguide.name}}] explains
how you can offer additional languages.
