== Overview

The purpose of this guide is to get you up and running as quickly as possible so that you can
play with and test drive various features that {{book.project.name}} has.  It relies heavily on the default database
and server configuration that come out of the box and does not get into any complex deployment options.  If you want a more
in depth discussion of any features or configuration options, you should consult the various other reference guides available.
