===== IDP Keys subelement

The Keys sub element of IDP is only used to define the certificate or public key to use to verify documents signed by the IDP.
It is defined in the same way as the <<_sp_keys,SP's Key's element>>.
But again, you only have to define one certificate or public key reference.
