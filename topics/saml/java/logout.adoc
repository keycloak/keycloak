==== Logout

There are multiple ways you can logout from a web application.
For Java EE servlet containers, you can call `HttpServletRequest.logout()`. For any other browser application, you can point
the browser at any url of your web application that has a security constraint and pass in a query parameter GLO, i.e. `http://myapp?GLO=true`.
This will log you out if you have an SSO session with your browser.
