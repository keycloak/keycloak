== Enabling Authorization Services

You can enable authorization services in any existing client application configured to use the OpenID Connect Protocol. However, in this guide we are
going to create a new client from scratch.

Click on the `Clients` left menu item to start creating a new client application and fill in the fields as shown below:

.Create Client Application

Click on the `Save` button to create the client. This should display the `Client Details` page.

.Client Details

In this page, click the `Authorization Enabled` switch and turn it `ON`, then click the `Save` button.
After saving, a new `Authorization` tab will show up in the tab set for the client. Click on this tab and you should see a page similar to the following:

.Authorization Settings

When you enable authorization services for a client application, {{book.project.name}} automatically creates several link:../../resource-server/default-config.html[Default Settings] for
your client authorization configuration.

For more details about authorization configuration, please see link:../../resource-server/enable-authorization.html[Enabling Authorization Services].
