===== How to secure your web applications inside Fuse

Basically all mentioned web applications require to inject {{book.project.name}} Jetty authenticator into underlying Jetty server . The steps to achieve it are bit different
according to application type. The details are described in individual sub-chapters.

{% if book.community %}
The best place to start is look at Fuse demo bundled as part of {{book.project.name}} examples in directory `fuse` . Most of the steps should be understandable from testing and
understanding the demo.
