The {project_name} Authorization can also help you to quickly get started with the authorization services and understand how to apply the same concepts to your
own applications.

If you are using the {project_name} Demo Distribution and you have it properly extracted in your file system:

* **keycloak-demo-{project_version}.[zip|tar.gz]**

you can check out the available examples from the following directory:

```bash
cd ${KEYCLOAK_DEMO_SERVER_DIR}/examples/authz
```

Or you can get them from https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/tree/{project_version}/examples/authz[GitHub].

Each example has a `README` file with instructions about how to build, deploy, and test the example.

Here is a brief description of each example:
