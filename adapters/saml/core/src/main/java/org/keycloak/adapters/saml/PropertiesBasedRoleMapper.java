/**
 * A {@link RoleMappingsProvider} implementation that uses a {@code properties} file to determine the mappings that should be applied
 * to the SAML principal and roles. It is always identified by the id {@code properties-based-role-mapper} in {@code keycloak-saml.xml}.
 * <p/>
 * This provider relies on two configuration properties that can be used to specify the location of the {@code properties} file
 * that will be used. First, it checks if the {@code properties.file.location} property has been specified, using the configured
 * value to locate the {@code properties} file in the filesystem. If the configured file is not located, the provider throws a
 * {@link RuntimeException}. The following snippet shows an example of provider using the {@code properties.file.configuration}
 * option to load the {@code roles.properties} file from the {@code /opt/mappers/} directory in the filesystem:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     <RoleMappingsProvider id="properties-based-role-mapper">
 *         <Property name="properties.file.location" value="/opt/mappers/roles.properties"/>
 *     </RoleMappingsProvider>
 * </pre>
 *
 * If the {@code properties.file.location} configuration property is not present, the provider checks the {@code properties.resource.location}
 * property, using the configured value to load the {@code properties} file from the WAR resource. If no value is found, it
 * finally attempts to load a file named {@code role-mappings.properties} from the {@code WEB-INF} directory of the application.
 * Failure to load the file from the resource will result in the provider throwing a {@link RuntimeException}. The following
 * snippet shows an example of provider using the {@code properties.resource.location} to load the {@code roles.properties}
 * file from the application's {@code /WEB-INF/conf/} directory:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     <RoleMappingsProvider id="properties-based-role-mapper">
 *         <Property name="properties.resource.location" value="/WEB-INF/conf/roles.properties"/>
 *     </RoleMappingsProvider>
 * </pre>
 *
 * The {@code properties} file can contain both roles and principals as keys, and a list of zero or more roles separated by comma
 * as values. When the {@code {@link #map(String, Set)}} method is called, the implementation iterates through the set of roles
 * that were extracted from the assertion and checks, for eache role, if a mapping exists. If the role maps to an empty role,
 * it is discarded. If it maps to a set of one or more different roles, then these roles are set in the result set. If no
 * mapping is found for the role then it is included as is in the result set.
 *
 * Once the roles have been processed, the implementation checks if the principal extracted from the assertion contains an entry
 * in the {@code properties} file. If a mapping for the principal exists, any roles listed as value are added to the result set. This
 * allows the assignment of extra roles to a principal.
 *
 * For example, consider the following {@code properties} file:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     # role to roles mappings
 *     samlRoleA=jeeRoleX,jeeRoleY
 *     samlRoleB=
 *
 *     # principal to roles mappings
 *     kc-user=jeeRoleZ
 * </pre>
 *
 * If the {@code {@link #map(String, Set)}} method is called with {@code kc-user} as principal and a set containing roles
 * {@code samlRoleA,samlRoleB,samlRoleC}, the result set will be formed by the roles {@code jeeRoleX,jeeRoleY,samlRoleC,jeeRoleZ}.
 * In this case, {@code samlRoleA} is mapped to two roles ({@code jeeRoleX,jeeRoleY}), {@code samlRoleB} is discarded as it is
 * mapped to an empty role, {@code samlRoleC} is used as is and the principal is also assigned {@code jeeRoleZ}.
