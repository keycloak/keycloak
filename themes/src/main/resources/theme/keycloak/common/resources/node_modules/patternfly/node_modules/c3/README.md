## Using the issue queue
The [issue queue](https://github.com/c3js/c3/issues) is to be used for reporting defects and problems with C3.js, in addition to feature requests and ideas. It is **not** a catch-all support forum. **For general support enquiries, please use the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js) at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js.** All questions involving the interplay between C3.js and any other library (such as AngularJS) should be posted there first!

Before reporting an issue, please do the following:

1. [Search for existing issues](https://github.com/c3js/c3/issues) to ensure you're not posting a duplicate.

1.  [Search the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js) to ensure it hasn't been addressed there already.

1. Create a JSFiddle or Plunkr highlighting the issue. Please don't include any unnecessary dependencies so we can isolate that the issue is in fact with C3. *Please be advised that custom CSS can modify C3.js output!*

1. When posting the issue, please use a descriptive title and include the version of C3 (or, if cloning from Git, the commit hash — C3 is under active development and the master branch contains the latest dev commits!), along with any platform/browser/OS information that may be relevant.

## Pull requests
Pull requests are welcome, though please post an issue first to see whether such a change is desirable.
If you choose to submit a pull request, please do not bump the version number unless asked to, and please include test cases for any new features. Squash all your commits as well, please.
