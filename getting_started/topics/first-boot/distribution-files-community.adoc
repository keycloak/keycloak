=== Installing Distribution Files

The {project_name} Server is contained in one http://www.keycloak.org/downloads.html[distribution file]:

* 'keycloak-{project_version}.[zip|tar.gz]'

The 'keycloak-{project_version}.[zip|tar.gz]' file is the server only distribution. It contains nothing other than the scripts and binaries
to run the {project_name} server.

To unpack these files run the `unzip` or `gunzip` and `tar` utilities.
