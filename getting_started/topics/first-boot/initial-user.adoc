=== Creating the Admin Account

After the server boots, open your browser and go to the http://localhost:8080/auth URL. The page should look like this:

.Welcome Page
image:{project_images}/initial-welcome-page.png[]

{project_name} does not have a configured admin account by default. You must create one on the Welcome page.
This account will allow you to create an admin that can log into the _master_ realm's administration console so that
you can start creating realms and users and registering applications to be secured by {project_name}.

NOTE:  You can only create an initial admin user on the Welcome Page if you connect using `localhost`. This is a security
       precaution. You can also create the initial admin user at the command line with the `add-user-keycloak.sh` script. For more details see
       link:{installguide_link}[{installguide_name}] and link:{adminguide_link}[{adminguide_name}].
