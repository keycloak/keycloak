=== Creating and Registering the Client

The next step you have to do is to define and register the client in the {project_name} Admin Console.

. Log into
the Admin Console with your admin account as you did in previous tutorials.  

. In the top left dropdown menu select and manage
the `demo` realm.  Click `Clients` in the left side menu.  The Clients page opens.

.Clients

. On the right click *Create*.  

. Complete the fields as shown below:
+
.Add Client

. After clicking the `Save` button your client application entry will be created.  You now have to go back to the {appserver_name}
instance that the application is deployed on and configure it so that this app is secured by {project_name}.  You can obtain
a template for the configuration you need by going to the `Installation` tab in the client entry in the {project_name} Admin Console.

. Select *Keycloak OIDC JBoss Subsystem XML*.  An XML template is generated that you'll need to cut and paste.
