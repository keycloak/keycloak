*Incorrect:* Create project. Delete object from editor. +
*Correct:* Create a project. Delete an object from the editor.
+
* Start steps with an active verb, such as *Enter*, *Edit*, and *Click*.
* Start headings with gerunds (verbs that end in -ing), such as *Configuring*, *Creating*, and *Installing*.
* Use *bold* for GUI items. Match the capitalization you see in the GUI.
* End entries in bulleted and numbered lists with periods when the entries are complete sentences.

** Always use numerals in ranges, even when either or both of the numbers are less than 10.
* Do not use Latin abbreviations, such as e.g., etc., and i.e.
** Instead, use "and so on" when you list a clear sequence of elements, such as "1, 2, 3, and
so on". Otherwise, rewrite the sentence to replace etc. with something more descriptive, 
such as "and other output".
** Instead of i.e. use "that is".
** Instead of e.g. use "for example" or "such as".
* Do not use "&" in place of "and".
