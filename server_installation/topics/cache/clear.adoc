=== Clearing Caches at Runtime

To clear the realm or user cache, go to the {project_name} admin console Realm Settings->Cache Config page.
On this page you can clear the realm cache, the user cache or cache of external public keys.
This will clear the caches for all realms and not only the selected realm.
