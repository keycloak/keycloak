=== RDBMS Setup Checklist

These are the steps you will need to perform to get an RDBMS configured for {project_name}.

. Locate and download a JDBC driver for your database
. Package the driver JAR into a module and install this module into the server
. Declare the JDBC driver in the configuration profile of the server
. Modify the datasource configuration to use your database's JDBC driver
. Modify the datasource configuration to define the connection parameters to your database

This chapter will use PostgresSQL for all its examples.  Other databases follow the same steps for installation.
