To enable all preview features start the server with:

[source]
----
bin/standalone.sh|bat -Dkeycloak.profile=preview
----

You can set this permanently by creating the file `standalone/configuration/profile.properties`
(or `domain/servers/server-one/configuration/profile.properties` for `server-one` in domain mode). Add the following to
the file:

[source]
----
profile=preview
----

To enable a specific feature start the server with:

[source]
----
bin/standalone.sh|bat -Dkeycloak.profile.feature.<feature name>=enabled
----

For example to enable Docker use `-Dkeycloak.profile.feature.docker=enabled`.

You can set this permanently in the `profile.properties` file by adding:

[source]
----
feature.docker=enabled
----

To disable a specific feature start the server with:

[source]
----
bin/standalone.sh|bat -Dkeycloak.profile.feature.<feature name>=disabled
----

For example to disable Impersonation use `-Dkeycloak.profile.feature.impersonation=disabled`.

You can set this permanently in the `profile.properties` file by adding:

[source]
----
feature.impersonation=disabled
----
