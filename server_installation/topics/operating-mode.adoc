== Choosing an Operating Mode

Before deploying {project_name} in a production environment you need to decide which type of operating mode
you are going to use.  Will you run {project_name} within a cluster?  Do you want a centralized way to manage
your server configurations?  Your choice of operating mode effects how you configure databases, configure caching and even how you boot the server.

TIP: The {project_name} is built on top of the {appserver_name} Application Server.  This guide will only
     go over the basics for deployment within a specific mode.  If you want specific information on this, a better place
     to go would be the link:{appserver_admindoc_link}[_{appserver_admindoc_name}_].
