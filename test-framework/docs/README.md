# Keycloak Test Framework

The Keycloak JUnit test framework makes it easy to write tests for Keycloak and extensions. Behind the scenes the
framework handles the lifecycle of Keycloak, the database, and any injected resources such as realms and clients.

Tests simply declare what they want, including specific configuration, and the framework takes care of the rest.
