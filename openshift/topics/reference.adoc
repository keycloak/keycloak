=== Artifact Repository Mirrors

// This page describes MAVEN_MIRROR_URL variable usage
// It requires 'bcname' attribute to be set to the name of the product

A repository in Maven holds build artifacts and dependencies of various types
(all the project jars, library jar, plugins or any other project specific
artifacts). It also specifies locations from where to download artifacts from,
while performing the S2I build. Besides using central repositories, it is a
common practice for organizations to deploy a local custom repository (mirror).

Benefits of using a mirror are:

* Availability of a synchronized mirror, which is geographically closer and
  faster.
* Ability to have greater control over the repository content.
* Possibility to share artifacts across different teams (developers, CI),
  without the need to rely on public servers and repositories.
* Improved build times.

Often, a repository manager can serve as local cache to a mirror. Assuming that
the repository manager is already deployed and reachable externally at
*_pass:[http://10.0.0.1:8080/repository/internal/]_*, the S2I build can then use this
manager by supplying the `MAVEN_MIRROR_URL` environment variable to the
build configuration of the application as follows:

. Identify the name of the build configuration to apply `MAVEN_MIRROR_URL`
  variable against:
+
----
oc get bc -o name
buildconfig/sso
----
. Update build configuration of `sso` with a `MAVEN_MIRROR_URL` environment variable
+
----
oc env bc/sso MAVEN_MIRROR_URL="http://10.0.0.1:8080/repository/internal/"
buildconfig "sso" updated
----
. Verify the setting
+
----
oc env bc/sso --list
# buildconfigs sso
MAVEN_MIRROR_URL=http://10.0.0.1:8080/repository/internal/
----
. Schedule new build of the application

NOTE: During application build, you will notice that Maven dependencies are
pulled from the repository manager, instead of the default public repositories.
Also, after the build is finished, you will see that the mirror is filled with
all the dependencies that were retrieved and used during the build.

|Set this to get some diagnostics information to standard out when things are
happening.
|*_true_*

|*_JAVA_INITIAL_MEM_RATIO_*
|This is used to calculate a default initial heap memory based the maximal
heap memory. The default is 100 which means 100% of the maximal heap is used
for the initial heap size. You can skip this mechanism by setting this value
to 0 in which case no `-Xms` option is added.
|*_100_*

|*_JAVA_MAX_MEM_RATIO_*
|It is used to calculate a default maximal heap memory based on a containers
restriction. If used in a Docker container without any memory constraints for
the container then this option has no effect. If there is a memory constraint
then `-Xmx` is set to a ratio of the container available memory as set here.
The default is 50 which means 50% of the available memory is used as an upper
boundary. You can skip this mechanism by setting this value to 0 in which case
no `-Xmx` option is added.

=== Known Issues
* There is a known issue with the EAP6 Adapter _HttpServletRequest.logout()_ in which the adapter does not log out from the application, which can create a login loop. The workaround is to call _HttpSession.invalidate();_ after _request.logout()_ to clear the Keycloak token from the session. For more information, see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-2665[KEYCLOAK-2665].
* The SSO logs throw a duplication error if the SSO pod is restarted while backed by a database pod. This error can be safely ignored.
* Setting _adminUrl_ to a "https://..." address in an OpenID Connect client will cause *javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException* exceptions on the SSO server if the default secrets (*sso-app-secret* and *eap-app-secret*) are used. The application server must use either CA-signed certificates or configure the SSO trust store to trust the self-signed certificates.
* If the client route uses a different domain suffix to the SSO service, the client registration script will erroneously configure the client on the SSO side, causing bad redirection.
* The SSO-enabled JBoss EAP image does not properly set the *adminUrl* property during automatic client registration. As a workaround, log in to the SSO console after the application has started and manually modify the client registration *adminUrl* property to *http://_<application-name>_-_<project-name>_._<hostname>_/_<app-context>_*.
