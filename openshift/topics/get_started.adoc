=== Using the {project_openshift_product_name} Image Streams and Application Templates

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat JBoss Middleware for OpenShift images are pulled on demand from the secured Red Hat Registry: link:https://access.redhat.com/containers/[registry.redhat.io], which requires authentication. To retrieve content, you will need to log into the registry using the Red Hat account.

To consume container images from *_registry.redhat.io_* in shared environments such as OpenShift, it is recommended for an administrator to use a Registry Service Account, also referred to as authentication tokens, in place of an individual person's Red Hat Customer Portal credentials.

To create a Registry Service Account, navigate to the link:https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/[Registry Service Account Management Application], and log in if necessary.

. From the *_Registry Service Accounts_* page, click *_Create Service Account_*.
. Provide a name for the Service Account, for example *_registry.redhat.io-sa_*. It will be prepended with a fixed, random string.
.. Enter a description for the Service Account, for example *_Service account to consume container images from registry.redhat.io._*.
.. Click *_Create_*.
. After the Service Account was created, click the *_registry.redhat.io-sa_* link in the *_Account name_* column of the table presented on the *_Registry Service Accounts_* page.
. Finally, click the *_OpenShift Secret_* tab, and perform all steps listed on that page.

See the link:https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[Red Hat Container Registry Authentication] article for more information.

To update to the latest {project_openshift_product_name} images, run the following commands:

. On your master host(s), ensure that you are logged in as a cluster administrator or a user with project administrator access to the global `openshift` project.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc login -u system:admin
----
. Run the following commands to update the core set of {project_name} {project_version} resources for OpenShift in the `openshift` project:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ for resource in {project_templates_version}-image-stream.json \
  {project_templates_version}-https.json \
  {project_templates_version}-postgresql.json \
  {project_templates_version}-postgresql-persistent.json \
  {project_templates_version}-x509-https.json \
  {project_templates_version}-x509-postgresql-persistent.json
do
  oc replace -n openshift --force -f \
  {project_templates_url}/$\{resource}
done
----
. Run the following command to install the {project_name} {project_version} OpenShift image streams in the `openshift` project:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc -n openshift import-image redhat-{project_templates_version}-openshift:{project_latest_image_tag}
----

=== Deploying the {project_name} Image
[[Preparing-SSO-Authentication-for-OpenShift-Deployment]]
==== Preparing the Deployment
Log in to the OpenShift CLI with a user that holds the _cluster:admin_ role.

. Create a new project:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc new-project sso-app-demo
----
. Add the `view` role to the link:{ocpdocs_default_service_accounts_link}[`default`] service account. This enables the service account to view all the resources in the sso-app-demo namespace, which is necessary for managing the cluster.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$(oc project -q):default
----

==== Deploying the {project_name} Image using the Application Template

===== Deploying the Template via OpenShift CLI

. List the available {project_name} application templates:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc get templates -n openshift -o name | grep -o '{project_templates_version}.\+'
{project_templates_version}-https
{project_templates_version}-postgresql
{project_templates_version}-postgresql-persistent
{project_templates_version}-x509-https
{project_templates_version}-x509-postgresql-persistent
----
. Deploy the selected one:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc new-app --template={project_templates_version}-x509-https
--> Deploying template "openshift/{project_templates_version}-x509-https" to project sso-app-demo

     {project_name} {project_versionDoc} (Ephemeral)
     ---------
     An example {project_name} 7 application. For more information about using this template, see https://github.com/jboss-openshift/application-templates.

     A new {project_name} service has been created in your project. The admin username/password for accessing the master realm via the {project_name} console is IACfQO8v/nR7llVSVb4Dye3TNRbXoXhRpAKTmiCRc. The HTTPS keystore used for serving secure content, the JGroups keystore used for securing JGroups communications, and server truststore used for securing {project_name} requests were automatically created via OpenShift's service serving x509 certificate secrets.

     * With parameters:
        * Application Name=sso

===== Deploying the Template via the OpenShift Web Console

Alternatively, perform the following steps to deploy the {project_name} template via the OpenShift web console:

. Log in to the OpenShift web console and select the _sso-app-demo_ project space.
. Click *Add to Project*, then *Browse Catalog* to list the default image streams and templates.
. Use the *Filter by Keyword* search bar to limit the list to those that match _sso_. You may need to click *Middleware*, then *Integration* to show the desired application template.
. Select an {project_name} application template. This example uses *_{project_name} {project_versionDoc} (Ephemeral)_*.
. Click *Next* in the *Information* step.
. From the *Add to Project* drop-down menu, select the _sso-app-demo_ project space. Then click *Next*.
. Select *Do not bind at this time* radio button in the *Binding* step. Click *Create* to continue.
. In the *Results* step, click the *Continue to the project overview* link to verify the status of the deployment.

==== Accessing the Administrator Console of the {project_name} Pod

After the template got deployed, identify the available routes:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,macros+"]
----
$ oc get routes
----

[cols="7",options="header"]
|===
|NAME |HOST/PORT |PATH |SERVICES |PORT |TERMINATION |WILDCARD

|sso
|sso-sso-app-demo.openshift.example.com
|
|sso
|<all>
|reencrypt
|None
|===

and access the {project_name} administrator console at:

* *\https://sso-sso-app-demo.openshift.example.com/auth/admin*

using the xref:sso-administrator-setup[administrator account].
