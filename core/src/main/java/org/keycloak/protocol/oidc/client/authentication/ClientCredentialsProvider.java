/**
 * The simple SPI for authenticating clients/applications . It's used by adapter during all OIDC backchannel requests to Keycloak server
 * (codeToToken exchange, refresh token or backchannel logout) . You can also use it in your application during direct access grants or service account request
 * (See the service-account example from Keycloak demo for more info)
 *
 * When you implement this SPI on the adapter (application) side, you also need to implement org.keycloak.authentication.ClientAuthenticator on the server side,
 * so your server is able to authenticate client
 *
 * You must specify a file
 * META-INF/services/org.keycloak.protocol.oidc.client.authentication.ClientCredentialsProvider in the WAR that this class is contained in (or in the JAR that is attached to the WEB-INF/lib or as jboss module
 * if you want to share the implementation among more WARs).
 *
 * NOTE: The SPI is not finished and method signatures are still subject to change in future versions (for example to support
 * authentication with client certificate)
